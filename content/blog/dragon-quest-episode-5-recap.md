Episode 4 Recap

  

Gomechan informs Popp that Avan has transformed into a Dragon using sign language.

Popp fears Dai might not be able to stop Avan and rushes to their fighting zone. Meanwhile, Brass refused to give up on Dai and forces him to fight Avan.

Dai remembering the Wave Slash Technique unleashes it onto Avan, who breathes fire towards Dai as he cuts it into half.

Dai succeeds in dodging the attacks, and Avan goes back to normal. Popp requests Avan to not use Puff dragon spell as it stings and hurts Avan with every transformation.

Avan informs Dai of Earth Slash for power and Wave slash for speed attacks. Together these spells would make him invincible. Dai helps Avan cure his nose sting by using the crystal formed by the crack spell.

Later the Demon King breaks into the magical barrier protecting the island, and Avan notices that he is the demon king Hadlar.

Hadlar reveals that Avan is the previous Hero who had defeated him. Hadlar plans on taking revenge for the pain and humiliation Avan caused him and attacks him.

Avan loses strength and drops down to Hadlar’s knees. Hadlar informs Avan of an even more powerful force named Lord Vearn. Vearn had resurrected Hadlar and now Hadlar is controlled by him.

Hadlar unleashes his wrath on Avan, Dai, and Popp. Hadlar fires a mighty blow that could finish Dai and Popp in a second when suddenly Avan jumps in front of the attack saving his students. Dai yells out Avan’s name when he collapses due to the attack.

The story begins with a young boy named Dai remembering a story told to him by his adoptive grandfather, the monster magician Brass, about the defeat of the Demon King Hadlar by the hands of a hero known as Avan. After the defeat of the Demon King Hadlar, all of the monsters were released from his evil will and peace reigned supreme around the world once again for ten years. Some monsters and demons moved to the island of Dermline to live in peace. Dai, the young protagonist of the series, is the only human living on the island. Having been raised by Brass and with his best friend, the monster Gome, Dai grows up dreaming of becoming a hero.

The true story begins when Avan, an instructor of heroes, comes to the island to teach Dai, by request of Leona, a princess who was previously saved by the boy. Avan offers Dai a full week of training which would create a hero out of him. Just after learning the second of Avan's three secret sword techniques, Dai's training is interrupted by the return of Hadler. Hadler announces to Avan that he had worked for an even more powerful evil king, the Great Demon King Vearn, who has resurrected him. Weakened by the spells he used to help Dai on his training, Avan nevertheless confronts Hadler. To protect his students and destroy Hadlar at the same time, he casts a spell called "Megane" (Sacrifice) which requires the caster's own life force to be used. The spell does not destroy the Demon King as Avan had planned, and Dai, Pop, Brass, and Gome are left to fend for themselves. Only the awakening of the hidden power within Dai, symbolized by the appearance of a strange mark on his forehead, leads them to defeat Hadlar and cause him to flee. Dai decides to leave the island with Pop to avenge Avan and defeat the Demon King and his master to bring peace back to the world.
