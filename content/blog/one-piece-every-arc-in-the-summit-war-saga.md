All the arcs are unique and two of them in particular are highly rated by the One Piece community. It is quite difficult to rank all the arcs because each of them is special in their own way. But, we will give it a fair go in this post. Here are all the arcs in the Summit War Saga ranked!

Amazon Lily Arc

After beaten ruthlessly by Bartholomew Kuma, Luffy was sent to Amazon Lily. The island was inhabited by women and Luffy was not welcome there. He had to fight against Boa Sandersonia and Boa Marigold, and in the meantime, he won the heart of Boa Hancock. It was on Amazon Lily that Luffy found out that Ace was going to be executed by the Marines. Luffy made up his mind that he was going to save his only brother. So, he sought help from Boa Hancock, who couldn't turn him down. This lead to the start of the mission "Save Ace".

Post-War Arc

After the crushing defeat of the Whitebeard Pirates, the entire world rejoiced as they believed that the Marines rid them of one of the most malevolent pirates in the world. Luffy was distraught; he watched Ace die in his arms. It fell to Jinbe to motivate his future captain and made him realize that Luffy still had his crew, who were waiting for him.

This was one of the most difficult times in Luffy's life, but he didn't give up. Luffy went to Marineford with a message for his crew inscribed on his arm. The arc also covered Luffy's childhood including the time when he met Ace and Sabo. The arc is perfect and it complimented the fast-paced Marineford arc. The post-war arc toned down the seriousness and showed how the brothers bonded together.

Impel Down Arc

In this arc, all hell broke loose. Luffy managed to enter Impel Down with help from Boa Hancock. Luffy had one goal in mind and that was to free his brother. He had no idea that it was going to be such a difficult job. Luffy almost got himself killed when he tried to fight against Magellan. But, Luffy didn't care about getting himself killed, he wanted to save his brother and he was willing to go to any lengths to do so. With help from Ivankov, Bon Clay, and a few others, Luffy managed to reach the level where Ace was being kept. However, he was met with disappointment when Jinbe told him that Ace was taken away to Marineford. Now, Luffy's goal became to chase away Ace and reach Marineford. In order to help Luffy, Bon Clay used himself as a distraction. He stayed behind which allowed him to open the Gates of Justice. This solidified the bond between Luffy and Bon Clay.

Sabaody Archipelago Arc

Sabaody Archipelago is one of the most highly rated arcs in the series. The arc saw all the Supernovas gathering together at the same place. If this wasn't enough, one of the members of the Roger Pirates was revealed. Silvers Rayleigh stole the spotlight when his real identity was revealed.

In this arc, Luffy did one of the most outrageous things; he actually punched a Celestial Dragon, which put all the pirates at Sabaody Archipelago in jeopardy. Sentoumaru and his Pacifista wreaked havoc on the island. To pile further misery on the pirates, Admiral Kizaru and Bartholomew Kuma were also present on Sabaody. Kizaru crushed several Superonovas with minimal effort. The Straw Hats suffered the most as all of them were sent to different places. The arc showed that Luffy and co. were not ready to enter the New World, that was crawling with insanely powerful pirates, who were merciless.Â 

Marineford Arc

The best arc in the Summit War saga is Marineford. The stakes were very high during the arc. Portgas D. Ace, the son of Pirate King, Gol D. Roger was going to be executed by the Marines. Adding to this, Ace was a member of the Whitebeard Pirates and their captain didn't like it if anyone of his crewmates was harmed. So, the Marines were ready for an all-out with Whitebeard who had the title of the Strongest Man in the World. The war at Marineford involved the Whitebeard Pirates, the Shichibukai, and the entire Navy.

The arc was a rollercoaster of emotions; in one instance it seemed that the Marines had the advantage and Ace was gonna be executed but then things would change quickly and the tide would turn in favor of the pirates. The entry of Luffy at Marineford made for an emotional reunion of the brothers. The arc ended with Ace and Whitebeard dying, thus the Marines emerged victorious. The arc also saw cameos from Shanks and Blackbeard. There are some really iconic moments in the arc and some of them will never be forgotten, but one will forever stand out among the rest; the confirmation of the existence of One Piece by Whitebeard. Truth be told, the arc remains the best arc in the entire series, but Wano might surpass it in the future.
