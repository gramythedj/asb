### Flame and Wind

Natsu beats Kageyama, whom Erza decides can dispel the wind barrier, locking them inside the Oshiban Station. Before Kageyama could threaten to comply, his guildmate Karacka was critically wounded to silence him. As the party thinks of another way out, Happy recalls that Virgo had given him her key to conveying to Lucy, who summons Virgo and uses the strength of the spirit to bury him from under the barrier; the Fairy Tail wizards take mercy on Kageyama and carry him along as well. Natsu and Happy are keeping up with Erigor when he flies to Clover and clashes with him. A windshield covers Erigor to negate Natsu's attacks.
