Enies Lobby and Marineford are two of the most incredible story in [One Piece](https://www.cbr.com/tag/one-piece/). While the former sees Luffy go up against the entire World Government to rescue one friend and tests the integrity of the crew, the other sees the biggest known event in the Great Pirate Era and One Piece in whole to date.

Enies Lobby: Tests The Crew

Enies Lobby is, hands down, the best arc a fan of the Strawhat Pirates could ever ask for. Not only does this arc give fans a great rescue story where the crew takes on the world just for one friend, but it also tests the integrity of the crew.

From Usopp's relationship with Luffy to the Going Merry, and even having faith in Nico Robin when faced by deception, this arc does ever so well to ensure the crew grows with this experience and stays together when faced by any obstacles.

  

Enies Lobby: Best Fights

When it comes to fighting sequences, Enies Lobby is truly unmatched. Every fan of One Piece is heavily invested in the Strawhat Pirates and loves to see them fight. In order to save Robin, all of them pushed themselves beyond all their limits and got stronger to defeat the CP-9. While Marineford does have some epic skirmishes, most of them were never truly fleshed out, making it look weaker in terms of fights.

Enies Lobby: Power-Ups

One of the best parts about any story, especially in anime and manga, is how the power-ups are handled. With Enies Lobby, the story did immensely well and introduced some of the most amazing power-ups for the Strawhats they took on the Cipher Pol. Techniques such as Sanji's Diable Jambe, [Zoro's Ashura Ichibugin](https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-characters-designs-fans-love-vs-average-ones-charlotte-katakuri-dracule-mihawk/), and Luffy's Gears remain etched in the fans' memories and are relevant to the story to this day.

Enies Lobby: Ohara And The Ancient Kingdom

The Ancient Kingdom lore is one of the biggest aspects of One Piece, if not the biggest. Although brief, the [Enies Lobby arc](https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-water-7-arc-sets-up-perfect-pay-off/) gave us a bit of information on who these people were, what kind of life they lived, and who their enemy was. In fact, the name of the Ancient Kingdom was almost dropped in Robin's flashback, however, Professor Clover was shot before fans could find out. What's more, the Ancient Weapons, specifically Pluton, was central to the arc, and once again, it tied to the history of the Ancient Kingdom as well.

  

Enies Lobby: The Going Merry

Where Marineford had the death of Whitebeard and Ace, Enies Lobby ended on a sad note as the Going Merry, one of the Nakama of the Straw Hat Pirates finally fell. Despite being a ship, Oda wrote this piece of story spectacularly and it moved every single fan to tears. Eventually, Franky joined the crew and built the ship of his dreams, the Thousand Sunny to replace Merry.
