**Sannin vs Team 7 Naruto**

[![sannin v Team 7](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PzDJwGwSewM/XxT7MuHNKtI/AAAAAAAACjE/SAl3pevUeoEtn52wYgMT103xyaAV9qyRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/maxresdefault%2B%25282%2529.jpg "sannin v team7")](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PzDJwGwSewM/XxT7MuHNKtI/AAAAAAAACjE/SAl3pevUeoEtn52wYgMT103xyaAV9qyRwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/maxresdefault%2B%25282%2529.jpg)

  

As a genin, the three were the students ofHiruzen Sarutobi, the ThirdHokage. During their time under Hiruzen's tutelage, they all learned to use theSummoning Technique, which they perform with their left hands.  
  
 Despite being a team and having accomplished great things together, the three members were always in constant disagreement with one another, which Tsunade referred to as a "three-way deadlock". Once they became skilled ninja able to look after themselves, Hiruzen's team was disbanded.

Hanzo names the "Sannin".

Despite the official dissolution of their team, the three continued to work together during the Second Shinobi World War. During one battle with Hanzō of the Salamander, they were the only Konoha ninja to survive Hanzō's attacks. 

  

As a reward for this, Hanzō dubbed them "Konoha's Legendary Sannin", a title that would follow them for the rest of their lives and which they themselves would use with pride. However, that same battle was the last one they fought together; happening upon a group of war orphans demanding training, Orochimaru proposed to kill them in order to end their suffering. Jiraiya however, chose to remain in Ame with them. By the time he had returned to Konoha, Tsunade had abandoned the life of a ninja and departed Konoha. Orochimaru, having been caught performing unethical experiments on his fellow shinobi, deserted the village. Jiraiya failed to stop Orochimaru from leaving and later left the village himself to track his and the Akatsuki's movements.

Because of their legendary skills and prowess, each of the Sannin has been considered for the position of Hokage at one time or another. Jiraiya was Hiruzen's preference for the position of Fourth Hokage, but he wasn't interested in the responsibilities.

  

 Orochimaru applied for the position, but Hiruzen did not believe Orochimaru had the village's best interests at heart and was passed over in favour of Jiraiya's student,Minato Namikaze. Hiruzen again wanted Jiraiya to become Hokage after the Fourth's death, but Jiraiya once again refused.

 After Hiruzen's death, theKonoha Councilasked Jiraiya to assume the position once more. Jiraiya declines once again, feeling unworthy of the title for failing to save the Third or Fourth, and feeling that the Hokage's duties would cut into his "research" time. However, Jiraiya offered to bring Tsunade back to the village, where she became the Fifth Hokage.

The three were never on good terms again following the Second Shinobi World War, and even though Jiraiya and Tsunade were frequently at odds with Orochimaru when they did meet, the three ever-remained deeply attached to each other. When rumours of Orochimaru's death reach Konoha, Jiraiya and Tsunade are saddened by the news, although relieved that he was no longer a threat. When Jiraiya once again ventured to Amegakure to investigate Pain, Tsunade bet that he would die, so that her legendary terrible luck would ensure his survival. Upon learning that Jiraiya was killed by Pain, Tsunade privately mourned for his loss.

During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Tsunade and Orochimaru, along with a reincarnated Hiruzen, worked together once again, with Tsunade claiming that had Orochimaru changed sooner, Jiraiya might still be alive. Orochimaru responded that anyone can change given enough time and that it was better for Jiraiya to have died than have changed.

  

Team 7

  

**Team 7** was a Konohagakure team formed under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake. Two-and-a-half years after Sasuke Uchiha left the village, Kakashi filled out paperwork to form **Team Kakashi**, with his former pupils Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno now being treated as equals alongside their teacher. Following Yamato and Sai joining the team, the group went by **Team Yamato** during the former's leadership.

Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are organised into a team following their graduation from the Academy in order to balance out their talents: Naruto, the worst student in his class, would benefit from Sakura's intelligence and Sasuke's proficiency with ninjutsu; Sakura would benefit from her more battle-capable teammates; Sasuke would benefit from being forced to work with others. Kakashi is selected to lead them in order to keep an eye on Naruto, Nine-Tails' jinchūriki and, in the anime, to help Sasuke cope with life after the Uchiha Clan Downfall, and as well to develop his Sharingan. 

As with all the previous genin teams he was put in charge of, Kakashi gives them a bell test in order to determine if they give the proper importance to teamwork. Unlike all previous genin teams, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura pass the test.

Team 7's early missions are all D-rank, which Naruto believes they are over-qualified for. He is able to pressure the Third Hokage into giving them a C-rank mission: escorting Tazuna to the Land of Waves. 

After starting the mission they discover that Tazuna lied about the mission details and that the mission is actually A-rank, far above the skills of genin. Despite this, Team 7 sticks with the mission and is able to see it through to its completion.

 When they return to Konoha they resume their menial, D-rank assignments, but from their performance, Kakashi believes they are qualified to participate in the Chunin Exams.

Despite strong showings from all three, particularly Naruto and Sasuke, none succeed in becoming chūnin. In the anime, they go on a few additional missions, but events during and after the Chūnin Exams lead Sasuke to believe that his membership in the team is preventing him from achieving his goal of killing his brother, Itachi. He defects from Konoha, joining forces with Orochimaru.

Sakura tries to convince him not to, Naruto is unable to stop him, and by the time Kakashi learns of what Sasuke has done, it was already too late. In the aftermath, Naruto leaves the village to train with Jiraiya and Sakura becomes the disciple of Tsunade, in effect disbanding Team 7.  

When Naruto returns to the village after two-and-a-half years, he, Sakura, and Kakashi form a "Reborn Team 7"  Kakashi gives them another bell test, but this time the only objective is to demonstrate how their skills have improved. As the team's first mission, they are sent to Sunagakure to rescue the Fifth Kazekage from Akatsuki, for which task they are reorganised into the Kazekage Rescue Team upon arrival in Suna.

  

 During the course of the mission, they learn of an opportunity to reunite with Sasuke, but Kakashi overexerts himself and needs to be extended bed-rest when they return to Konoha. Because they have only a limited amount of time to make to use of the intel, an Anbu codenamed Yamato is assigned as Kakashi's replacement. To provide additional manpower to the team, Sai of Root is added to the team as Sasuke's replacement.

  
  
  

[![Team Yamato](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/6/66/Team_Yamato.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20160108120926)](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/6/66/Team_Yamato.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20160108120926)

Team Yamato's first mission.

  

Although the team is successful in infiltrating one of Orochimaru's hideouts and meeting with Sasuke, his growth over the last few years is more than any of them can compete with and they can do nothing but let him escape. 

  

From the mission, however, Sai becomes a trusted and lasting member of the team and Yamato takes on a recurring role as leader and advisor to Team 7's members, especially as Kakashi increasingly commits himself to other tasks. 

  

When a Kakashi-led Team Asuma struggles in another confrontation with Akatsuki, Yamato leads Team 7 in providing backup. Shortly afterwards, when they come up with a plan to find Sasuke by first finding Itachi, a Yamato-led Team 7 combines with a Kakashi-led Team 8 into the Eight Man Squad.

  
  
  

[![Naruto saves Sakura](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/8/8e/Naruto_saves_Sakura.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20150124174623)](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/8/8e/Naruto_saves_Sakura.png/revision/latest?cb=20150124174623)

The original Team 7 reunited.

  

The Eight Man Squad is unsuccessful in stopping Sasuke from falling into the clutches of the Akatsuki. When, following Pain's Assault, recent news of Sasuke's criminal activity with Akatsuki reaches Konoha, Naruto tries to secure a pardon for him from the Raikage, who refuses. 

  

Meanwhile, Sasuke's former classmates decide that they should be the ones to personally kill him for what he's done and to prevent the chaos his actions could bring. Sakura accepts the responsibility, yet plots to kill him on her own due to Sai's unwittingly encouraging her to do so, but ultimately can't bring herself to do so, and nearly lost her life. 

  

Kakashi, on learning of her plans and believing the crisis to be his responsibility due to his own failure to prevent Sasuke from going rogue, offers to do it himself as Sasuke's former teacher. Naruto intervenes before anybody is able to kill anyone else, in the process reuniting all of Team 7's original members for the first time in three years. 

  

Naruto and Sasuke briefly clash, but both accept they are too evenly matched and postpone a final resolution between them for another time.

  
  
  

[![Kaguya&#039;s Defeat](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/7/7c/Kaguya%27s_Defeat.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20160825114025)](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/7/7c/Kaguya%27s_Defeat.png/revision/latest?cb=20160825114025)

Team 7 defeats Kaguya.

  

Despite the nature of their prior meeting, all the members of Team 7 emerge on the same side during the Fourth Shinobi World War, with not even Sasuke wanting the world to fall victim to the Infinite Tsukuyomi. They join forces first against the Ten-Tails, then its jinchūriki Obito Uchiha, and then Madara Uchiha, but through various setbacks and despite various successes the world is enslaved by the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Sasuke is able to protect Naruto, Sakura, and Kakashi from the Infinite Tsukuyomi's effects, leaving them the only ones to face a new and final threat: Princess Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. 

  

After a prolonged fight, Kakashi is able to create an opening with assistance from Obito, Sakura is able to block Kaguya's escape, and Naruto and Sasuke are able to seal her, ending the war. However, Sasuke revealed his alliance with them was a means to an end, stating his plan to start a revolution by killing the tailed beasts and the current Kage. 

  

Naruto opposes him and they fight in order to settle their feud once and for all. Ultimately, after they are injured to the point of being unable to move and lost a respective arm, Sasuke surrenders and accepts his friendship with Naruto.

For his contributions during the war, Sasuke is pardoned for his previous crimes on the good words of Naruto and Kakashi.

 He re-allies himself with Konoha but leaves the village to wander the world. At the same time, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and Naruto, Sai and Sakura all take on new roles, effectively disbanding Team 7 on good terms. Over the next several years, Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga, they have two children, Boruto and Himawari, Naruto succeeds Kakashi as the Seventh Hokage. Sasuke and Sakura get married and have a daughter, Sarada, and Sai marries Ino with whom he has a son, Inojin.

Years later, Boruto and Sarada, alongside Orochimaru's son Mitsuki, are placed together for their genin team. Influenced by their parents' past, Sarada requested that their assigned team designation be changed from Team 3 to Team 7, which Naruto granted.

At max power, who is the strongest of the legendary Sannin?

  

This is tough. But I think it comes down to this. Tsunade's main function was healing and chakra control. And while she was very, very good at that, Jiraiya and Orochimaru were simply more powerful than she was, in their primes respectively. Now we need to talk about Jiraiya and Orochimaru. Because they were similar in a lot of ways. 

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OSONowAa7aE/XxT76_XFBcI/AAAAAAAACjY/dwlKxV7EFuE_jbwFskWkrE4gJBbxyGlZACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/sannin3.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OSONowAa7aE/XxT76_XFBcI/AAAAAAAACjY/dwlKxV7EFuE_jbwFskWkrE4gJBbxyGlZACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/sannin3.jpg)

  

Jiraiya in his prime was a master of Toad Sage Jutsu. Bath of Boiling Oil, Toad Flame Bombs, Rasengans for days, all complete with the face of a toad. Jiraiya was a legend. And Gamabunta/Gamaken are two of the greatest summons ever. Period. But now we get to Orochimaru. 

  

A master of Ryuchi Cave jutsu, Orochimaru achieved something only Mitsuki (his son) has achieved before or since; Incomplete but constant Sage mode. Orochimaru is always in sage mode. So in that respect, he beats Jiraiya. But technique and jutsu are the two determining factors in this answer. In his prime, Orochimaru was able to turn himself into a giant 8-headed snake that could give Itachi's Susanoo a run for its money. We have Edo Tensei (perfected), all five nature releases, countless wind release techniques, and his curse mark that he developed.

  

 He gave Danzo the Sharingan and Hashirama's cells. And he has the second greatest blade ever forged. The sword of Kusanagi is second only to the Blade of Totsuka in terms of power. It expands and shrinks on command, can cut through anything. ANYTHING. Not to mention. Orochimaru as a human is only the form he chooses.

He is, in reality, a giant white snake made of millions of smaller snakes. Orochimaru is a god among Sannin and a god among ninja. Naruto remarked in Boruto that the older Orochimaru gets the younger he gets. It's impossible to counteract, plus the fact that he can never really die. I've just gotta say Orochimaru is the strongest among them. And one of the 3 strongest of his generation (Minato, Orochimaru, Itachi, not necessarily in that order). He's definitely the strongest of the three, and he is the only one that is still relevant.

  

  

Are Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura the new legendary Sannin since they can summon the same animals as the old legendary Sannin?

  

  

The Legendary Sannin: Tsunade, Jiraiya and Orochimaru were the three students of Sarutobi Hiruzen who once in their youth had fought Hanzo of The Salamander toe to toe for a long time. Hanzo was so impressed at their feat, that he spared their lives and gave them the name “The Legendary Sannin of Konoha”. This has nothing to do with their summons and it was at the time when Orochimaru was still in Hiruzen’s care.

The 3-way dead-lock: This is the term used for the 3 summons of the Legendary Sannins. Their summons is counter-balancing to each other, as the Frog eats Slugs, the Snake eats Frogs & the Slug kills Snakes. This definitely became more prominent after Orochimaru had left Team Hiruzen, as otherwise, they would have no business fighting each other anyway.

So, it’s quite clear that Naruto, Sasuke & Sakura have the new 3-way deadlock summons and also that future generations of Shinobis and Kunoichis would probably know Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke as the “Legendary 3 of Konoha” as they were the ones that ended the great war.

However, they have never formally been given the title of “The Legendary Sannin” by anyone. So, in essence, they are The Legendary Sannin at heart, but not on paper.

They didn't receive the term “Sannin” but they are definitely better than the old ones. Hanzo at his peak was strong but compared to Sage of Six paths Naruto and Rinnesharingan Sasuke, he's of no match. I won't talk much about Sakura, as she's pretty much useless as always.

 Naruto single-handedly defeated the six paths of Pain with Sage mode which Jiraiya wasn't able to do even. So just think how much strong Naruto is with Kurama’s link and power of Sage of Six Paths. As for Sasuke, Ems, rinnegan…. That should be enough. The 3 legendary Sannin of the leaf wasn't able to defeat Hanzo. But, the final war arch Team 7 is pretty frickin strong and they can defeat Hanzo even in his prime. So they will definitely get the name, “Legendary Sannin".
