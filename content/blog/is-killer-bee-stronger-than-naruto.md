[Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) is stronger by the sheer, raw power of both Sage and Kyuubi Chakra Mode, and by virtue of having the strongest Jinchuuriki.

Naruto V Killer Bee

  

Doesn't mean [Killer Bee](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Killer_B) will lose. If they don't fight with their Jinchuuriki, then Bee is much, much more powerful and more experienced than Naruto.

  

Killer Bee also has as much endurance than Naruto, so overpowering Bee or fighting a battle of attrition won't work against Bee. Not sure if [Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) can outwit Bee, too.

  

Bee seems the type to think outside the box if his 8-sword style and throwing a pencil at Kisame are taken into account.

One of the most influential characters in Naruto's journey, Killer Bee was introduced to us as the Jinchuuriki of the Eight-Tails, Gyuki. Bee's training was so harsh that he managed to gain complete control of his beast, and become a perfect Jinchuriki.

  

According to the Raikage Ay, Bee was even stronger than him, which gives one a hint of his battle prowess. His partnership with Gyuki is genuinely amazing to watch as the two fight together like partners, which is what sets them apart from the other jinchūriki.

  

Bee's fight against the entirety of Team Taka was enough proof that he is indeed one of the strongest jinchūriki that we've seen in the series.

Killer Bee

  

[Naruto Uzumaki's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) very own father, Minato, ranks on this list as well. Before his death, Minato split the nine-tails into two halves; Yin and Yang.

  

The Yin half of Kurama was sealed within himself, while the Yang half was sealed within Naruto. When Minato was reanimated during the 4th Great Ninja War, he had already mastered the nine-tails that was sealed within him, and hence became a perfect Jinchuriki as well.

  

Even without the nine-tails, Minato was already one of the most powerful characters to ever live, which is evident from the fact that he was the 4th Hokage of the leaf.

  

**Let us look at facts through which we can compare who is stronger as follows:**

  

  

[Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) V [Killer Bee](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Killer_B) comparison
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

**1.** the tails determine the maximum amount of charka and so the 9-tails is more powerful at 100% than the 8-tails, however, Naruto only has 50% of the 9-tails until he defeats Sasuke so that’s really not in Naruto’s favour. **Win:** Killer Bee

  

**2.** Naruto is an Uzumaki and their clan is known for having insane amounts of chakra even before the 9-tails is mixed in. It’s the reason they’re designated as the 9-tails Jinchuriki in Konoha. This means that even without the tailed beasts, Naruto has far more charka and stamina than Killer Bee. **Win:** Naruto

  

**3.** Naruto has a sage mode. Now, before Karuma accepts Naruto, he can’t use the full extent of sage mode, but even without, his power is evident. This also extends his chakra baseline a lot and allows him a plethora of new attacks and abilities. **Win:** Naruto.

  

**4.** once Naturo has Karuma on his side, he can do tailed-beast sage-chakra mode. This put him over the top since Bee can do tailed-beast chakra mode, but doesn’t have a sage mode so Bee can’t even compete with Naruto. **Win:** Naruto.

**5.** 6 Paths Naruto. Add everything above plus 6 paths chakra and he can summon Truthseeker orbs, fly, and sense attacks and he’s basically a god at this point. **Win:** Naruto.

  

As from the above facts, you can see that overall **Naruto is stronger than [Killer Bee](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Killer_B). **
