at the end of the episode, we see something strange as it is the revival of Divine tree, I was completely shocked as victor managed to grow a complete divine tree and what he plans with is we don't know yet but we can say that in the coming episodes we can see the introduction of KARA clan and also much-awaited Kashin koji.

  

this episode is not as boring as other Boruto episodes but finally, we got to see some thrillingÂ  as a divine tree
