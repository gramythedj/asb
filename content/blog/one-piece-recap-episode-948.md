The anime adds the following:  

Raizo finding Kawamatsu's sword.  
Raizo fighting Solitaire.  
Zoro and Hiyori ambushed by a disguised ninja.  
Big Mom waking up briefly during the transport to Onigashima.  
Kid asking Killer to help remove their shackles.  

  

  

Solitaire's combat abilities are shown while they were not seen in the manga.  
  

In the manga, the prisoners immediately released Luffy when Kiku threatened them. In the anime, they do not budge until after Hyogoro reveals himself.
