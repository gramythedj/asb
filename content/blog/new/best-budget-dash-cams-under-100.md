## Buyer’s guide to dashcam

-   Stabilization
    

Image stabilization is the most important feature to look for in a dashcam. I don’t have to go into detail on what shaky cam looks like, think of the movies, the Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield.

You do not need your dashcam to possess shaky video! Though you won’t be driving on potholes or bumpy roads, there will be quick acceleration and braking and you don’t want your footage to have a rolling shutter or the jello effect. There are several ways to combat this.

-   EIS and OIS
    

Various dash cams, like action camera, with Electronic Image Stabilization. It possesses internal software to cancel out the car’s vibrations and form a precise picture. Software is always improving, a few years ago EIS was subpar, but now you can expect noticeable results. There is also OIS or Optical Image Stabilization which is stabilization on a mechanical level. It physically moves the camera lens to compensate for camera movement. No dashcam possess this characteristic so no need to get sad! Focus on EIS!

-   Mounts
    

Owning a dash cam suction cupped to your windshield is a really fine idea .ut don’t discount other methods. Stabilizing a camera is just about decreasing nearby vibrations and possessing a steady mount.

Inclusively for racing, we recommend utilizing a headrest mount Very stable, and the camera angle gives you a view of the wheel along with the track. It doesn’t block your vision at all as there is nothing occupying your windshield or wires to get in your view. A standard dash cam will have a wire going to the power outlet so taping it so it doesn’t obstruct your shifter or buying a USB Cable Extender might be an option for you.

-   Image Quality/Viewing Angle
    

Two important features that can hand-in-hand are image quality and viewing angle. Image quality is self-explanatory, but if you’re using this cam as a street dash cam, you would like to be ready to read license plates. Having a lens that is able to handle lighting internally and externally is vital.

This comes right down to how the camera handles exposure. Don’t worry about our recommendations, we’ve reviewed the footage to ensure pristine picture quality. Viewing angle will nearly always be some kind of wide-angle. Especially with the headrest mount, you want to capture as much as possible. Our recommendations make sure the viewing angle is sufficient to capture your shifter, steering wheel, the driving force and therefore the entire road.

-   Portability
    

Depending on your need, you may want to consider portability. If you’re reading this text purely in seartrtrtracking then a touch cam with A battery may be a must. It will allow you flexibility in terms of mount position, and not need to worry about connecting to an influence source.

Be sure to purchase extra batteries! You can mount a GoPro on the surface of your car and not worry about it slump. It gives me the chills thinking of a touch cam doing an equivalent thing. If my dashcam fell from my knees to the floor it would break. It’s not meant for that type of handling.

-   High Frames per Second (FPS)
    

Debatable whether or not high FPS or frames per second is worth it. Having a high FPS feature on a camera allows you to shoot in slow motion, and creates smoother shots.

The downside to the present is that the file size can get bigger, thus limiting the quantity of your time you film. A standard FPS is 24 or 30 fps. Whereas high FPS is generally 60 fps+. Bottom line, if you think that you’ll be doing slo-mo, getting a camera that has high FPS is sensible
