### Fairies in the Wind

The Fairy Tail wizards are pursuing Eisenwald to the train station in Oshibana, assuming that Erigor plans to relay Lullaby's song through the station's speaker system to kill innocent people. Although Natsu and Gray pursue Erigor, Erza single-handedly defeats most of the remaining wizards with her magical weapons and armor. After Erza evacuates the area, Erigor traps her and the other wizards inside an impenetrable windshield until they fly south. In the meantime, Gray hears from the Eisenwald wizard Rayule that Erigor's real goals are Makarov and the other legitimate guild masters at a conference in the nearby town of Clover.
