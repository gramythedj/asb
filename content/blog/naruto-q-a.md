Question: How many people were staying in Naruto's family?

  

Answer: 

  

Naruto’s family tree is a bit complicated. It depends on how far you want to stretch it. With Naruto’s direct descendants you have Minato Uzumaki, his father and the 4th Hokage and Naruto’s mother, Kushina Uzumaki. The Uzumaki name actually comes from his mother, Kushina as the name belongs to a clan originating from the now gone Whirpool Country in the Naruto World.

In regards to the Uzumaki, there are hints of Pain being part of the clan as he possessed their signature scarlet hair colour as Kushina had. While a clone made from Kushina’s DNA was created by Orochimaru named Karin.

  

Naruto’s mom is Kushina, whereas his dad is the Fourth Hokage, Minato. The Uzumaki are related to the Senju, so in other terms, Naruto is slightly related to The First and Fifth Holage. I believe the Uzumaki are from the Yeti Village or something like that, but we’re killed off and Kushina along with Nagoto and Karin are a few of the lone survivors. Nagato and Karin are Uzumaki, so somewhere down the line, they’re related to Naruto. Naruto also has two children, boruto and Himawari with Hinata Hyuga. That being said, he has a father in law and a sister in law

  

Question: Who was the first to accept Naruto for who and what he was?

  

Answer:

  

Hiruzen Sarutobi was the first, knowing him as the son of the Fourth since his birth. Next was Iruka, being the one to introduce Naruto to Teuchi and Ayame, after finally managing to look past his preconceptions of Naruto.

Over Sakura's objections, Naruto and Sasuke head to the hospital roof to fight. Regarding the battle casually, Naruto asks Sasuke to put on his Konoha forehead protector. Sasuke refuses since that would mean that they are equals, upsetting Naruto for not acknowledging himself as Konoha ninja. Naruto surrounds Sasuke with shadow clones, which Sasuke destroys with his Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique. As the smoke clears Sasuke sees that one clone has survived and is helping Naruto form the Rasengan. He uses his own Chidori and they charge at each other. Sakura screams for them to stop.

  

At the Valley of the End, Naruto recalls Neji's words about Sasuke being in darkness. Sasuke explains that based on Itachi's life, he's come to the conclusion that a true Hokage is one who shoulders the hatred of others. Sasuke intends to concentrate all power and all hatred on himself. Naruto points out others would not agree with his plan, but Sasuke doesn't care. Sasuke is certain he has all the power he needs to carry out his plan. Naruto argues there are things that can't be done alone, as the fight against Kaguya. By killing the tailed beasts and the Kage, Sasuke wants to erase the darkness of the past. Naruto denounces erasing the past, having been shaped by his past as well. Hagoromo begins fading away and tells Kakashi to keep having faith. Thinking of their answers, Hagoromo fades. Naruto and Sasuke begin fighting, first with taijutsu. Sasuke attacks with fireballs, which Naruto dodges. Naruto creates clones, which attack with Rasengan. Using the Rinnegan, Sasuke pulls Naruto and his clones toward himself and skewers them with black flames. The real Naruto blocks it with chakra arms and attacks Sasuke from above with more arms. Entering Six Paths Sage Mode, Naruto continues attacking with chakra arms. Sasuke sends another fireball his way, which Naruto blocks. Sasuke teleports behind Naruto and sends him back with Chidori. Sasuke begins firing Susanoo arrows, which Naruto blocks with his Truth-Seeking Balls. Sasuke switches to a Complete Body Susanoo, and Naruto enters Tailed Beast Mode just in time to parry Sasuke's attack, fist-bumping him in the process. The two see each other's loneliness as children. Sasuke has Susanoo blow fireballs at Naruto, who dodges them, blocks Susanoo's swords with Kurama's tails, and tosses Susanoo down with them. Naruto hesitates using a Tailed Beast Ball when Susanoo is down, giving Sasuke an opportunity of using Kirin. Sasuke chastises Naruto for stalling. Naruto refuses to let Sasuke go alone again. The two clash with a Susanoo: Chidori and a Tailed Beast Ball. In each other's minds again, Sasuke expresses the need to kill Naruto. Naruto points out there's no guarantee the world Sasuke creates won't have the same darkness as before, and that the five villages are finally united at peace. Sasuke argues the only reason that happened is that we’re forced to band together to defeat common enemies in Akatsuki, Madara, and Kaguya. Naruto asks what happens after Sasuke dies, no longer fulfilling the role of a common enemy. Sasuke answers that with the power of the Rinnegan, he has many ways of leading from the shadows. Still annoyed at Naruto's insistence in not killing him, Sasuke calls forth the Chibaku Tensei the tailed beasts are sealed in, in his first step into the shadows.
