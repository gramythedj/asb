Gueldre Poizot is the former Captain of the Purple Orcas at the start of the series. Gueldre is a successful merchant who used his Transparency Magic, which renders him invisible and unaffected by magic, to rise up in society by selling top-secret magic items and smuggling hazardous materials. He carried out his activities within the Magic Knights, using his captain status to physically intimidate his subordinates. Gueldre's activities are eventually exposed when he is revealed to have enabled the Eye of the Midnight Sun to attack the capital when they offered him wealth for the mage who maintained the capital's barrier. When the Elves begin their assault on the Capital, Gueldre is forced to ally himself with Revchi while attempting to escape in the chaos with the two endings up in the Shadow Palace.

Kaiser Granvorka is the current Captain of the Purple Orcas following Gueldre's arrest, referred to as the Clover Kingdom's "ultimate shield," due to his mastery of Vortex Magic, which intercepts and disperses his opponent's magic. He would later be revealed to host to an Elf Apostle that Fuegoleon faces in the Shadow Palace.

#### Revchi Salik

Revchi Salik is a former member of the Purple Orcas and the first antagonist Yuno and Asta encounter at the start of the series, possessing Chain Magic that allows him to nullify any magic. That ability resulted in him being discharged from the Magic Knights after being set up by Gueldre on a failed mission that scarred his face with burns. When Yuno acquires his four-leaf grimoire, Revchi plotted to steal it but is defeated when Asta acquired his five-leaf grimoire and used it to nullify Revchi's chains. When the Elves begin their assault on the Capital, Revchi attempted to get revenge on Gueldre before the two realize they both hate Asta for ruining their plans and end up working together to fend off the attacking Elves.

#### Xerx Lugner

Xerx Lugner is the vice-captain of the Purple Orcas and is an ice mage known as the Saint of Pure Ice. While assumed by many to be virtuous and protective of his squad's honour, he is actually a corrupt Magic Knight who is abusive towards commoners and those weaker than himself. While normally stationed at Clover Kingdom's border, he returns to the capital to take part in the Royal Knight selection exam before being brutally beaten by Zora Ideale for his treatment of a commoner woman. Xerx is later possessed by an elf spirit who attempts to destroy the town of Hecairo before Asta defeats and exorcises the elf.
