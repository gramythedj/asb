Ninja in Naruto uses a variety of impressive techniques to defeat their enemies. They're especially proficient in ninjutsu,genjutsu, senjutsu, and taijutsu. Taijutsu is often overlooked, but it's actually pretty formidable.  

Essentially hand-to-hand combat, this fighting style closely resembles something human beings in the real world could potentially use. Yes, it's often combined with impossible techniques – you will never see anyone in an actual martial arts tournament rapidly grow their bones and use them as spears – but most taijutsu techniques are based in reality.

Anime fans may never be able to use the Sharingan, but they sure can judge the best taijutsu users Naruto has to offer.

**Might Guy**

![Might Guy is listed (or ranked) 1 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In 'Naruto'](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/80/1583343/original/might-guy-photo-u12?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Might Guy is one of the taijutsu titans. Consequently, he's able to teach his student Rock Lee to be a formidable ninja without using any other kind of jutsu.

Though Guy can use chakra, he primarily studies genjutsu and taijutsu. This dedication allows him to go toe-to-toe with Madara, a ninja impervious to everything except taijutsu and senjutsu.

**Rock Lee**

![Rock Lee is listed (or ranked) 2 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In 'Naruto'](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/97/1927781/original/rock-lee-photo-u22?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Rock Lee can't use chakra, so he's limited to a few techniques. However, with the help of his teacher, Might Guy, Lee masters taijutsu. By age 13, he is able to pass through five of the Eight Gates and clear all of the four short years later.

Accordingly, Lee can overcome his body's limitations and master the Crane Wing Formation, which helps him demolish half a meteorite.

When he drinks alcohol, Lee wields taijutsu even more formidably. His mental limits disappear, and he becomes an unstoppable punching force.

**Madara Uchiha**

![Madara Uchiha is listed (or ranked) 3 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In 'Naruto'](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/816/16306156/original/madara-uchiha-photo-u19?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Madara Uchiha isn't just one of the most powerful ninja, he's also an accomplished taijutsu user. Though he primarily uses ninjutsu, Madara can take down hundreds of opponents at once with a mere hit.

After becoming immune to all but taijutsu and senjutsu attacks, this fighter squares off with Might Guy, a taijutsu master. He's overjoyed to have a worthy opponent, proving he greatly respects the art.

**Neji Hyûga**

![Neji Hyuga is listed (or ranked) 4 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In 'Naruto'](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/84/1660118/original/neji-hyuga-photo-u9?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Neji's byakugan allows him to see people's chakra pathways, which he can attack and manipulate with the Gentle Fist technique.  Neji is initially forbidden from learning this signature Hyûga technique, but he teaches himself Gentle Fist anyway. The style involves almost unperceptively quick movements that are impossible to perform without great strength and dexterity.

After he trains under Might Guy, Neji greatly improves his taijutsu skills, allowing him to fully utilize his family's style.

**Itachi Uchiha**

![Itachi Uchiha is listed (or ranked) 5 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/1618/32353066/original/itachi-uchiha-photo-u34?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Itachi Uchiha might not use taijutsu as his primary fighting style, but he's almost supernaturally skilled at it. As a 13-year-old boy, he takes down Konoha Military officers with little difficulty. His movements are so nimble it seems like he creates ninjutsu signs without even moving his hands.

Sadly, his incredible prowess in both taijutsu and ninjutsu make him a huge target.

**Tsunade**

![Tsunade is listed (or ranked) 6 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/166/3318746/original/tsunade-photo-u28?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Out of the Legendary Sannin, Tsunade is perhaps the best known for her skills in taijutsu. She possesses an incredible power that allows her to put cracks in the ground with a single finger, beat her teammates Jiraiya and Orochimaru, and breakthrough Sasuke's ultimate defence, Susanoo.

Tsunade passes her skills onto her protege, Sakura, along with her medical ninjutsu.

**Killer B**

![Killer Bee is listed (or ranked) 7 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/3682/73639230/original/killer-bee-photo-u11?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Killer B would rather be renowned for his rap prowess than for his taijutsu, but he's a whole lot better at taijutsu than making music. Specifically, he uses disturbance taijutsu to attack his opponent with extreme speed from multiple locations.

The movements are incredibly difficult to track. Killer B also favours wrestling moves, putting his enormous muscles to good use. 

Might Duy

![Might Duy is listed (or ranked) 8 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50087/1001731688/original/might-duy-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Might Duy is Might Guy's father, and while he isn't as skilled as his son, his efforts are worth noting. Might Duy spends 20 years mastering a complex taijutsu technique called the Eight Gates. He can bypass an incredible amount of physical limitations to ultimately use all of his muscular force.

However, accomplishing this feat often proves fatal, and Duy dies in the process. 

**Naruto Uzumaki**

![Naruto Uzumaki is listed (or ranked) 9 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/83/1647832/original/naruto-uzumaki-photo-u50?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

As the protagonist of the series, Naruto has a number of impressive talents, and taijutsu is one of them. Initially, Naruto's taijutsu skills are actually quite weak, but he trains extensively with Jiraiya and improves. 

Naruto can take out multiple opponents without using ninjutsu and draining his chakra. Though the title character might focus more on ninjutsu and senjutsu, he can still throw a punch with the best of them.

**Kimimaro**

![Kimimaro is listed (or ranked) 10 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/816/16306050/original/kimimaro-photo-u5?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Kimimaro's primary technique, Shikotsumyaku, allows him to manipulate his bones at will, turning them into powerful weapons. However, this ability would likely be completely useless if Kimimaro didn't know taijutsu.

Turning your ribcage into a series of knives is impressive, but having the physical strength and stamina to wield them is what really counts in battle.

Shira

![Shira is listed (or ranked) 11 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50087/1001731796/original/shira-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Like Rock Lee, Shira can't use chakra, so it seems like he won't be able to learn ninjutsu or taijutsu. At first, he isn't allowed to enter the Land of Wind's Ninja Academy due to this inability, but Kazekage Gaara gives Shira a chance to try his luck in training.

Shira pushes himself and learns a variety of taijutsu techniques, including the Seven Heavens Breathing Method (which allows him to take in massive quantities of air and increase his endurance) and Silent Fist (which lets him attack soundlessly). 

**Kakashi Hatake**

![Kakashi Hatake is listed (or ranked) 12 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/68/1343066/original/1343066-photo-u41?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

You wouldn't want to mess with Kakashi in close combat. Ever since he was a Genin, Kakashi possessed fast reflexes and advanced combat prowess. He's also able to open at least one of the Eight Gates. Perhaps the best showcase of his taijutsu skills is during his final fight with Obito.

A (Fourth Raikage)

![A (Fourth Raikage) is listed (or ranked) 13 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50113/1002249047/original/1002249047-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

A, the Fourth Raikage is only second to Minato in terms of speed. Even those with the Sharingan have trouble copying his movements. His signature fighting style is nintaijutsu - a combination of ninjutsu and taijutsu. He's also got incredible strength as evidenced when he breaks through Susanoo and severs the Eight-Tails' horns.

Chen

![Chen is listed (or ranked) 14 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50087/1001731805/original/chen-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Laudable warrior and taijutsu user Chen fakes his own death after his student dies during a war. When Team Guy discovers Chen's survivance, Rock Lee begs the old master to help him with his taijutsu. Chen refuses because he doubts taijutsu alone can carry a ninja through battle.

However, Chen pioneers a Leaf Dragon God attack; it creates a dragon-shaped tornado that can cut anyone to ribbons.

**Sasuke Uchiha**

![Sasuke Uchiha is listed (or ranked) 15 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/100/1980623/original/1980623-photo-u83?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

It's easy to overlook Sasuke's taijutsu skills since he's known for his Lightning Release. But Sasuke is a formidable taijutsu user. His movements are always super clean and precise. And his Sharingan certainly gives him an advantage in hand-to-hand combat. Sasuke's most notable Taijutsu technique is the Lion Combo which he used during the Chunin Exams.

**Sakura Haruno**

![Sakura Haruno is listed (or ranked) 16 on the list The 16 Greatest Taijutsu Users In &#39;Naruto&#39;](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/99/1962884/original/sakura-haruno-photo-u53?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Sakura Haruno starts with hardly any taijutsu skills, but over the course of the series she improves significantly. After extensive training with her mentor Tsunade, Sakura is strong enough to split the earth with a single punch and can even wreck hundreds of Sasori's puppets at once.
