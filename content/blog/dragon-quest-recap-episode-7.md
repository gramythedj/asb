Dai and Popp reach the dark forest and rescue a little girl named Mina. The three are completely lost and cannot seem to find their way to the village which frustrates Popp as he thought Dai would be good with directions.

A wolf monster tries to attack Mina but is quickly beaten by her from atop a tree. Popp runs into another girl who is later revealed as Maam. Mina greets her with a smile and Maam seems to have worried about Mina being missing all this time.

Mina says she was out to look for herbal medicine for her mother who was struck by a poisonous slime. Maam gets introduced to Dai and Popp as rescuers of Mina and Maam reveals that she is a village of Nayle Village.

Maam informs that a lot of monsters seem to have been living in the forest since the Dark Lord’s return.

Meanwhile, Hadlar quickly gets a hold of Dai’s plan to reach Romos Castle and asks Crocodine the beast king for help. Hadler reveals that Dai has immense power and will be a worthy opponent for Crocodine to challenge.

Interested by this proposal, Crocodine challenges Dai to a fight later on. The two fight and Dai are injured. Maam uses her power up skills on Dai and pours her powers into him.
