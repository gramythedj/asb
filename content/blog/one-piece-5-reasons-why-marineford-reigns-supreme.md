Enies Lobby and Marineford are two of the most incredible story in One Piece. While the former sees Luffy go up against the entire World Government to rescue one friend and tests the integrity of the crew, the other sees the biggest known event in the Great Pirate Era and One Piece in whole to date.

Marineford: Biggest War

The war of Marineford was triggered with the capture of Portgas D. Ace by Marshall D. Teach, who later handed him over the World Government for a place among the Shichibukai. To save his son, Whitebeard attacked the Navy HQ and thus began the greatest ever battle fought in the Great Pirate Era. This war showed fans what a true battle in the One Piece world is like and gave everyone a good taste of what to expect from the major wars in the future.

Marineford: Stronger Characters

The Marineford arc of One Piece is filled with some extraordinary characters. Being the biggest known event in the Great Pirate Era to date, Marineford saw the Navy put forward their strongest and combine them with the Shichibukai to taken on the Whitebeard Pirates. With the Strongest Man in the World, the 16 Division Commanders, and 43 ally ships, the Whitebeard Pirates were also a menace in combat.

Marineford: Big Deaths

Eiichiro Oda doesn't like to kill people in his story often, and whether people like it or not, that's how the manga had always been. However, with Marineford, Oda deemed that two deaths were absolutely necessary and the way they were handled was majestic. With Ace, Oda paved way for Luffy to get stronger so that he never has to lose anyone ever again, and later on, with Whitebeard, Oda finally dropped curtains on the old era and signalled the beginning of the age of the new generation.

Marineford: End Of An Era

The Marineford arc marked the end of an era. With the death of Whitebeard, pirates from all over the world were motivated to find the One Piece. Furthermore, the empty [Yonko](https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-strongest-organizations-in-the-series/) position started a war for power among the pirates, and ultimately, Blackbeard was the one who won. The conclusion of the war also influenced the [Worst Generation](https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-characters-stronger-than-trafalgar-law/) and lots of them set off to the New World to make a name for themselves and find the One Piece.

Marineford: The Balance Of Power

The conclusion to Marineford saw the balance of power shift forever in the world of One Piece. With the fall of Whitebeard, several pirates let loose on areas under his protection and the seas became even more dangerous than ever. Eventually, all this serves as a major set-up for the Great War that will engulf the entire world at some point in the future. Luffy will definitely be central to that war and it's highly likely that arc will surpass both Enies Lobby and Marineford.
