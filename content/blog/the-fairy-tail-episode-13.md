### Natsu vs. Yuka the Wave User

Lyon reveals his intention to battle and conquer Deliora, something that Ur has struggled to achieve, thereby making his dream of surpassing his teacher come true. Gray is seriously hurt, but the partly frozen Natsu finds him and returns to the village, where Natsu eventually thaws. Three of Lyon's followers—Sherry Blendy, Yuka Suzuki, and Toby Orrolta—come to the top of Angelica, Sherry's gargantu rodent, who pours a flume of acidic jelly on the village to kill it, but Natsu saves the villagers by dispersing the jelly with his fire sorcery. Since Natsu beats Yuka and Toby, Lucy fights with Sherry, who has the ability to guide the divine spirits, Lucy.
