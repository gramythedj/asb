Chakra is the basis for nearly all kind of Jutsu in the world of Naruto. Shinobi, over generations, have tried to hone their chakra to get stronger, however, some characters in the series are simply born with more chakra, such as the members of the Uzumaki Clan, while others are given the ability to draw this power from massive chakra pools, such as the Jinchūriki in the world of Naruto.

Here are 10 Naruto characters who possess more chakra than even the Tailed Beasts who possess enormous amounts of chakra.

Killer Bee

One of Kumogakure's strongest shinobi, Killer Bee is the Jinchūriki of the Eight-Tails, also known as Gyuki. Being a perfect Jinchūriki, Bee has gained access to massive amounts of power, which includes a humongous pool of chakra as well.

As seen during the Fourth Great Ninja War, Killer Bee was strong enough to continue fighting several dangerous enemies without tiring. Thanks to Gyuki, he could even hold his own against multiple Tailed Beasts at once and even overwhelm them to a certain extent.

Third Raikage

The Third Raikage was quite easily one for the strongest in the history of Kumogakure, if not the strongest. Known for his insane durability, the Third Raikage only received a single scar in his entire lifetime, one he had inflicted upon himself. What's more, he was capable of fighting for several days and nights in the Third Great Ninja War, proving that his chakra levels were greater than an average shinobi's.

If there was any doubt remaining, the Third Raikage is known to have fought against the Gyuki on several occasions. In fact, he was responsible for cutting off one of his horn, as seen in one of the flashbacks in the story.

Madara Uchiha

One of the strongest characters in the series, Madara Uchiha was born as the reincarnation of Indra Otsutsuki which made sure that his chakra was stronger even among the regular Uchiha. Having been born and raised in battle, Madara's battle prowess, and consequently his chakra reserves proved to be quite great. After implanting Hashirama's cells in his body, his chakra grew even further. Finally, becoming the Jinchūriki of the 10 Tails drastically boosted his chakra to the point where he was said to be approaching the level of Kaguya Otsutsuki. Madara could've grown even further had Zetsu not stabbed him to bring Kaguya Otsutsuki back to life.

Hashirama Senju

Hashirama Senju, just like Madara, was born on the battlefield and even among the Senju, he was known to have great chakra reserves. He barely ever tired in battle and his Sage Mode ability made him nearly invincible as far as the regular shinobi go.

In his fight against Madara Uchiha and the Nine-Tails, Hashirama proved how massive his chakra reserves were by fighting and defeating both of them by himself, a feat few shinobi could achieve. Although he was surpassed by many, Hashirama's chakra pool is one of the greatest in the entire Naruto series.

Kisame Hoshigaki

Famed as the Tail-less Tailed Beast, Kisame Hoshigaki was one of Naruto's strongest characters. Thanks to his blade, Samehada, Kisame's power grew further as he was able to shave chakra from his enemies.

Incredibly enough, Kisame was able to hold his own against Killer Bee, a perfect Jinchūriki. It goes without saying that his chakra was comparable to that of a Tailed Beast, and with Samehada at his disposal, it could easily surpass that mark.

Naruto Uzumaki

Naruto Uzumaki is the strongest known shinobi in the history of the Naruto series and the Seventh Hokage of Konohagakure. Being an Uzumaki, Naruto's chakra reserves are already massive, and on top of that, they are further boosted by him being the Jinchūriki of both Yin and Yang halves of Kurama.

Furthermore, Naruto also has the chakra of all the other Tailed Beasts at his disposal along with the Six Paths Yang powers, making him an incredibly powerful character. Although his chakra isn't as great as Kaguya's, it is certainly greater than the likes of Madara Uchiha.

Sasuke Uchiha

Nonetheless, Sasuke's chakra is great enough to see him fight against Momoshiki Otsutsuki despite being drained by transporting 8 people to a new dimension with his Rinnegan. Added to that is his Six Paths Yin power, which gives his chakra another boost. When compared to a mere Tailed Beast, Sasuke is miles ahead.

Hamura Otsutsuki

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EfZpf-9cG43cic_qFdBF99yQuZ2WvawC_7YV8OMFm63df4ghnEcED0udGsg4juAz4LY14fw_mCrR4zKnXBOTkdH8ZuXxuGDG-oAD6NYbFwgVhQAkZva_OLrcWdwbuvA-akAWEUJQ=s1600-rw)

The younger child of Kaguya, Hamura Otsutsuki was born with inhuman amounts of chakra. Thanks to his mother, Hamura didn't even need to weave signs to use chakra. It has been hinted that he didn't need food or sleep either.

Coming over to his chakra reserves, they were just as monstrous as he appears to have been. Hamura Otsutsuki fought his mother Kaguya Otsutsuki for months without even resting until she was finally sealed away. This alone indicates that his chakra was massive and well beyond that of a Tailed Beast.

Kaguya Otsutsuki

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/UC-927HPj43fI7gJEkRhWk_IEbdNyiAADOtevjMYQljsfH0X3IS60646i3VkLfKEK2r1IjlWbKd2y5gvTCd2YpD0Gzb5t1rFrg4dst3PUb2DJjsDW9ffrvnI3WSvfezWAnmMiLVS=s1600-rw)

Kaguya Otsutsuki was quite possibly the strongest character in the entire Naruto series and it goes without saying that her chakra was the greatest as well. According to Naruto and Sasuke, Rikudo Madara Uchiha's chakra was nothing compared to Kaguya's, something that puts into perspective how powerful she was.

Kaguya could fight for months when at full power, as seen when she fought against Hagoromo and Hamura Otsutsuki at one point. Further testament to her strength is the fact that her chakra could create an Expansive Truth-Seeking Ball capable of wiping out the entire space-time.

Hagoromo Otsutsuki

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/TPDWEdXO5hrzpXC_lIRhKPu2MNJZKsLKZhXVwvq1i8SsRXsZ1NJwydDekWOiXuX2vw_SlLMGAPMv3BuwvGD5xWw8NaVOS4C18KSHmzUvJzf-R6UDLKdrcKd-Ah-XwGM-aAlW3XB1=s1600-rw)

Another one of the monsters, Hagoromo Otsutsuki was just like his brother, Hamura, when it came to chakra and inhuman powers, however, it has been implied on countless occasions that he was, indeed, stronger. He had enough chakra to fight Kaguya Otsutsuki for months without tiring and what's shocking is the fact that he became the Jinchūriki of the 10 Tails after that.

In his prime, Hagoromo could've been possibly stronger than even Kaguya, however, drawing a comparison between the two is quite difficult indeed. Nonetheless, his chakra was comparable to Kaguya herself, if not greater.
