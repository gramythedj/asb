The storyline is so lovely, and the illustrations are so sweet. I'm not surprised that anyone likes Demon Slayers because I fan this fantastic novel, and after reading volume 1, my curiosity is growing. It's advantageous to see what happens next in volumes 2,3,4 and so on. I would consider reading and viewing Demon Slayers to other fans of manga/anime (even for my family and friend who are not that much into anime and manga)

  

#### I really love how dark it gets, especially when his sister becomes a demon, but she does not have her humanity like most demons do. The handle is not long dragged but launches straight into the plot.

Art uses shaky lines, which are difficult to get used to. You're used to simpler, polished styles, but this art really does make the tale well told. There is nothing particularly fresh about shouting, which makes it do well. Tanjiro, also, is a beautiful, precious roll of cinnamon.  

The art is another minor concern as if, to be honest, I had with it personally. It does not currently match up to many other popular mangas. Don't demand a smooth look from many of your favourites for some genuinely rough and jagged linework of characters. Curiously, the setting looks better than the protagonists, albeit a little petty. Koyoharu does a lot of good work and loves to give most characters their very detailed clothing designs.  

Tanjiro is his youngest sister, Nezuko, a caring and courageous elder sibling. My children like the character of Tanjiro a lot. My children are in secondary and secondary education. You want to hear about Mr Urokodaki's Tanjiro experience preparation. My children respect the selfless commitment of Tanjiro to support Nezuko and the poor. They also love the part of the plot, where the people who came before Tanjiro got assistance. My kids like the poet's stories, Mr Gotouge, to encourage them to know the cruel facets of life. The characters were compassionate as they sensed hope, sadness, and pleasure.

I didn't hate this manga at the end of the day or even disdain it excessively. It would certainly be enjoyed by the younger crowd whose better representations have not spoiled. It was not new or excellent, but it somehow helped me look at life and turn the page. I found myself running through it, where ordinarily I would take my time to read the manga to enjoy the art. Having said that, I don't have to read the next one in any way.

This is one of my favourite manga and I died to get physical copies. I found that, after purchasing brand-new volumes, the volumes are somewhat impaired. The one had one year on its back. I would say that I find a more hard-covered edition of this after a second reading.

Volume 4 provides more detail about Zenitsu's death and how his grandfather educated him with his discipline and hard love. Zenitsu has backlashes that made him understand how he cherished and helped his grandparents. Inosuke continues learning more from Tanjiro and Zenitsu about human customs and proper behaviour.

==========================================================================

Tanjiro and Nezuko are defending each other and ferociously battling one of the Douze Kizuki demons' attacks. Shinobu reveals her chemistry ingenuity. After Giyu saves him, Inosuke has a fanboy. Once more, Tanjiro and Giyu meet. There are perfect antagonists. However, not all of them have a history, however they're a pleasant insight into the whereabouts of these demons and the way they ended. I love to see them fighting, too. The fights between Tanjiro and Nezuki and Zenitsu and Innosake are fantastic.

[Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Vol. 7: Trading Blows At Close Quarters](https://amzn.to/3t7jjJS)
==================================================================================================

To grab passengers inside, Enmu the demon fuses its body with a wagon. This deadly train leads passengers and demon slayers through dreams which expose their unconscious aspirations and hopes. Tanjiro, with his departed family, pulls out of his fantasy and challenges Enmu. The dream pictures of Tanjiro are gross. I like the charismatic and outgoing character of Rengoku. Rengoku instructs demon slayers to split themselves into small groups to battle the demon and shield travellers. A retrospect from the history of Kanao shows more of Shinobu and Kanae. I like the polite and enthusiastic attitude of Kanae.

A new strong benefit is learned by learning the secrets of Hikonami kagura and Flame breathing.

Tanjiro, Inosuke, and Zenitsu have smoked out Daki, a demon who has fooled inhabitants of an entertainment district for years, amid some comic misunderstandings that bled almost to its cover Hashira Tengen Uzui and his fellow Ninja are engaged in Daki, but when they can't live with it, what a chance Tanjiro and his friends can afford to take one of the Higher Ranked demons of Kibutsuji.
