Jack the Ripper is the Captain of the Green Praying Mantises, a sadist who loves destruction and considers Yami a rival, wanting to fight seriously against him someday. He uses Severing Magic to create arm blades of mana. The more he slashes, the properties of his mana change to match his opponent's magic, allowing him to slash through most magic, having even been stated to be able to cut through mountains.

#### Sekke Bronzazza

Sekke Bronzazza is a young womanizer who entered the Magic Knights Entrance Exam for the chance of joining a high-standing Magic Knight Squad, attempting to manipulate Asta whom he considered the worst participant to make himself look good. However, Sekke lost to Asta in the combat test and was only accepted into the Green Praying Mantises, having since bore a grudge on Asta who refers to him by his "Bah-ha" laugh. Sekke uses Bronze Magic to create and manipulate bronze in various ways. After "saving" King Augustus from a possessed Coral Peacock magic knight, he became his personal attendant from that moment on, much to his reluctance as he was running away from the chaos the demon caused in the kingdom.
