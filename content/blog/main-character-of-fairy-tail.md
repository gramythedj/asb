The protagonists of the series are members of the Fairy Tail Guild, where they realize what their fellow members deem to be the Guild's most powerful unit due to their high magic strength and coordination. It initially consists of Lucy Heartfilia, Natsu Dragneel, and Happy at the Heavenly Spirit Plue's recommendation shortly after Lucy enters into the guild. It later grows to include Gray Fullbuster and Erza Scarlet after several joint tasks. Wendy Marvell and Carla are both considered part of the squad.

### Natsu Dragneel

The main star of the series is Natsu Dragneel. He was trained from a young age by Dragon Igneel to become a Dragon Slayer, a dragon-like physiology sorcerer whose abilities were equipped to fight dragons. Using his Fire Dragon Slayer Magic, Natsu is resistant to flames and able to absorb them to fuel his attacks, which involve breathing fire and combustion of some portion of his body for use when he is struck; however, he suffers from motion sickness when he is in a car of any kind.  

After Igneel's disappearance on July 7, X777, Natsu hunted for the dragon and was ultimately taken to Fairy Tail, where he finally became one of the most aggressive members of the Guild known as "Salamander." Eventually, it is discovered that Natsu is a demon known as "Etherious Natsu Dragneel" (E.N.D.) sent 400 years ago by his brother, Zeref Dragneel, as part of a greater plot to destroy both Zeref and the evil dragon Acnologia.

### Lucy Heartfilia

Lucy Heartfilia is the main heroine of the series. She is a teenage debutant of the rich Heartfilia family who embarks on a quest to join Fairy Tail, which she does after Natsu Dragneel rescues her from a slave trader posing as a Fairy. The tail member under his own alias "Salamander." She carries out paying guild assignments with Natsu and Happy to support her leased house in Magnolia and is also exasperated when her teammates unintentionally minimize their payout for their disruptive stunts. She is also an up-and-coming author who finally publishes her debut novel based on her experiences at the guild at the end of the series.  

As a celestial magician, she uses magic keys to call celestial spirits, gathering ten of the twelve rare golden keys that summon the powerful zodiac spirits as the series progresses. She can also battle alongside her spirits with a whip and finally gain the ability to send mystical Star Dresses that give her exclusive access to her zodiac spirits' powers.

### Happy

Happy is a blue-furred anthropomorphic cat named Natsu Dragneel's best friend and only traveling companion at the beginning of the season. Using a magic talent called Aera, Happy will transform into a winged cat and fly at high speeds. He uses this form to hold Natsu in the air, and he is the only one who rides Natsu without succumbing to motion sickness. Before the beginning of the season, Happy was hatched from the egg discovered by Natsu and Lisanna Strauss, who called him "Happy" after his birth, and the claim that the rest of the guild had. Eventually, Happy learns his heritage as an Exceed from Edolas. He is split from his parents Lucky and Marl until he was conceived as part of their queen's plan to evacuate 100 Exceed children to Earth-land before their kingdom's destruction.

### Gray Fullbuster

Gray Fullbuster is an ice sorcerer who is a fierce competitor to Natsu because of his competing characters and supernatural elements. Orphaned by the Etheric Deliora at the age of eight, Gray is taught by Ur to use Ice-Make, which immediately creates ice in the shape of any weapon or entity that he imagines; during his preparation to survive cold temperatures, he often takes the practice of subconsciously stripping his clothing, something that Mashima, based on his own personal habit, does. After Ur, he joins Fairy Tail and sacrifices to save himself.  

Later in the series, Gray inherits Ice Demon Slayer Magic from his revived father, Silver, becoming a Demon Slayer to carry out Silver's will to destroy E.N.D. His demonic powers' corruptive influence compels Gray to fight irrationally against Natsu by discovering his identity as an E.N.D. Still, at the end of the day, he uses his powers to help strip Natsu of his identity as an Etheric so that he can normally live as a human being.

### Erza Scarlet

Erza Scarlet is the S-Class swordswoman of Fairy Tail, dubbed "Titania" for her fame as the most powerful female guild sorcerer, referring to the Fairy Queen of Midsummer Night's Dream. She uses magic called "The Warrior" to immediately "require"—exchange and equip—a range of arms and weapons that alter her already tremendous strength and supernatural skill. Abandoned at childhood by her mother, Irene Belserion, Erza was enslaved at the Tower of Heaven at 11 and befriended Jellal Fernandes, who gave her the surname "Scarlet" after her red hair.  

She first unlocks her magical ability while leading a slave rebellion, betrayed by a brainwashed Jellal and forced to leave the tower alone. Her experiences led her to join Fairy Tail and become a severe yet caring punitive man who, in the absence of Makarov Dreyar, was briefly the seventh master of the guild when the guild was revived a year after the death of Tartaros. In the course of the Fairy Tail, Erza grew fond of her mates during their adventures.  

The character is named after Eru from Mashima's one-shot Fairy Tale manga, who acted as a Fairy Tail pilot. Initially, Mashima modeled her to shed only tears from one eye due to her artificial eye defect. Still, ultimately she discarded this part after unintentionally drawing several scenes where Erza had tears streaming from both eyes. He also said that he sometimes forgets what the armor of Erza looks like, and he updates the pattern every time it appears.
