Rill Boismortier is the Captain of the Aqua Deers, able to bring what he paints to life and recreate any magic attribute via his Picture Magic. When he received his grimoire, he shut himself away in frustration, struggling to find artistic inspiration, causing destruction during bouts of anger. His butler and friend Walter taught him to acknowledge others' feelings, encouraged him to share his art, and inspired him to join the Magic Knights. He is the youngest of the Magic Captains, at age 19 - a mere 4 years above Asta and Yuno. He has a casual, laid back attitude befitting his age and enjoys conversing with people closer to his age like Asta, as he has to be overly polite with the other Magic Captains, who are older than him. He becomes friends with Asta after seeing the youth's Anti-Magic and learning of his age. When Patry conducted the ritual to revive the Elf race, Rill became the vessel of the Elf Lira of the Apostles of the Sephirah. Getting used to his new body and powers, Lira accompanies Patry to Shadow Palace where he holds off Asta and Mimosa before getting on Charmy's bad side and unknowingly awakening her Dwarf heritage. He develops a crush on Charmy's adult form based on his vague memories of possession (not knowing it was Charmy), and she serves as an inspiration for his art, and thus, his strength.
