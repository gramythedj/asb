Charlotte wraps her team’s crystal and runs with it to safety while the other captains keep on destroying the area around them.

Jack wanted to attack Dorothy and Fugeliona burns him with flames. Charlotte is worried about why she has to clash with Yami and why she jin the training where she has to face him. Why they are still talking about sti\\cking to the plan Jack and Yami appears. Yami and Jack’s side doesn’t stick with the plan they just go with the flow.
