Charlotte Roselei is the Captain of the Blue Rose Knights to use Briar Magic, allowing her to manipulate thorny rose vines. Charlotte portrays herself as a cold and confident woman with an apparent dislike towards men despite a secret crush on Yami. This is a result of Charlotte suffering a childhood curse inflicted on her by her family's enemies, a forbidden spell that activated upon the age of 18 to cause Charlotte's mana to go berserk to kill her and anyone around her. Although the only method to break the curse is by knowing love, Charlotte instead attempted to train herself to enforce control over her magic. However, it resulted in her nearly being killed until Yami risked himself to save her, resulting in her feelings for Yami breaking the curse. Charlotte is too shy to express her feelings to Yami and instead sets up a veil of mockery and self-superiority. Still, in the aftermath of her possession of the elf spirit Charla, who briefly battled Yami before joining the others to fight Zagred, Charlotte attempts to express her feelings to Yami with her subordinates' support.

#### Sol Marron

Sol Marron is a member of the Blue Rose Knights and is a 3rd Class Intermediate Knight who uses Earth Magic. She joined the Magic Knights after being saved by Charlotte as a child, and as such is very protective of Charlotte and refers to her casually to the latter's dismay. She is initially hostile to Yami until she was forced to allow him to deal with Charlotte's elf spirit and has since been tolerant of him.
