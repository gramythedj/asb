The Z Fighters - 'Dragon Ball Z'

![The Z Fighters - 'Dragon... is listed (or ranked) 1 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775872/original/the-z-fighters-dragon-ball-z-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

If you ask the average anime fan who the strongest fighter is, chances are they're going to say Goku - and those who don't will probably pick Vegeta instead. The Z Fighters - the team to which these Saiyan warriors belong - is full of powerful fighters. But it's not just huge muscles and beams of concentrated energy that make the Z Fighters great - they also have members who focus on intellectual pursuits, like Bulma.

Together, the members of the Z Fighters are powerful enough to take on dangerous enemies like Frieza, Cell, and more.

The Seven Deadly Sins - 'The Seven Deadly Sins'

![The Seven Deadly Sins - ... is listed (or ranked) 2 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50103/1002041695/original/the-seven-deadly-sins-_the-seven-deadly-sins_-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

In the Kingdom of Liones, the strongest order of Holy Knights is a team of seven ruthless criminals called the Seven Deadly Sins. As their name implies, each member has been guilty of committing one of the seven sins. Despite their rough appearances and the false accusations made against them, their combined powers and strength have made them legends greatly admired by fellow Holy Knights and apprentices. Only this team of skilled ex-convicts can help the princess reclaim their kingdom from evil oppressors. 

The Gotei 13 - 'Bleach'

![The Gotei 13 - 'Bleach' ... is listed (or ranked) 3 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50103/1002041847/original/the-gotei-13-_bleach_-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

The Gotei 13 is the main military branch of Soul Society and is comprised of some of the most esteemed Shinigami. They are separated into 13 different divisions with each one being led by a Captain-Commander. Whether it's to protect the Human World from Hollows or defending the Seireitei, this is an impressive army that many Shinigami at the academy hopes to join. 

The Straw Hats - 'One Piece'

![The Straw Hats - 'One Pi... is listed (or ranked) 4 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775871/original/the-straw-hats-one-piece-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

The Straw Hats are a powerful group of pirates who sail the high seas in search of treasure. Each member brings something different to the table: Luffy is outlandishly strong and possesses the ability to stretch his body like gum; Usopp isn't as physically intimidating, but he has common sense on his side, and Chopper can turn into a muscle-bound reindeer.

There are plenty of other powerful and compelling characters among the group, and each is cunning with an unflagging loyalty to their fellow members, making them one of the strongest teams around.

The Akatsuki - 'Naruto'

![The Akatsuki is listed (or ranked) 5 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/3670/73380580/original/the-akatsuki-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Naruto features several teams that boast incredible power, but the most formidable might be the Akatsuki. The Akatsuki's goal is to collect all nine Tailed Beasts - powerful creatures sealed inside peoples' bodies - and harness them as weapons to help them invade ninja villages.

The group consists of some of the most powerful and ruthless ninja in the world of Naruto - chief among them being Itachi, who massacred his entire clan with no assistance when he was only 13 years old; Hidan, a functional immortal; and Kisame, a powerful shark ninja whose weapon absorbs the energy of others and gives it to him.

Aside from the obvious atrocities committed by the Akatsuki, the group is also embroiled in a conspiracy that could easily lead to the destruction of the entire world.

Fairy Tail Guild - 'Fairy Tail'

![Fairy Tail Guild - 'Fairy Tail is listed (or ranked) 6 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50103/1002041863/original/fairy-tail-guild-_fairy-tail_-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Considered by many to be the strongest guild in Fiore, Fairy Tail is renowned for its valour, unwavering beliefs, and teamwork. And while the main members constantly bicker and get on each other's nerves, it's their close friendship and bonds that make them an unstoppable team.

The Pillars - 'Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba'

![The Pillars - 'Demon Slayer: K is listed (or ranked) 7 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50103/1002041910/original/the-pillars-_demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba_-photo-u2?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

In the Demon Slayer Corps, the nine strongest members belong to an elite group of swordsmen called the Pillars. Each Pillar has its own distinct Breath Style that they learned from previous masters. They are the only demon slayers known to be able to kill members from the Twelve Demon Moons, making them a threat to the existence of demons. 

Black Bull Squad - 'Black Clover'

![Black Bull Squad - 'Black Clov is listed (or ranked) 8 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50103/1002041974/original/black-bull-squad-_black-clover_-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

It's difficult not to root for the underdogs. Although they started out as the worst squad among the Magic Knights, slowly but surely they're securing their place at the top. Especially after coming in second to the famous Golden Dawn squad at the Star Awards Festival. As the story progresses, each member works hard to improve upon their weaknesses and work as a team to succeed in their missions. 

Team Urameshi - 'Yu Yu Hakusho'

![Team Urameshi - 'Yu Yu Hakusho is listed (or ranked) 9 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775873/original/team-urameshi-yu-yu-hakusho-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Team Urameshi includes the five warriors who participate in Yu Yu Hakusho's Dark Tournament: Yusuke Urameshi, Kurama, Hiei, Kazuma Kuwabara, Genkai, and Koenma. Urameshi and Kuwabara are spirit detectives who spent a lot of time getting into fights in high school, Hiei and Kurama are demons with terrifying powers, Genkai is an experienced martial artist who taught many of the other characters everything they know, and Koenma is an actual god.

They're strong enough to eventually win the tournament, which is no easy feat by any means.

The League Of Villains - 'My Hero Academia'

![The League Of Villains - 'My H is listed (or ranked) 10 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775884/original/the-league-of-villains-my-hero-academia-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

The League of Villains is the biggest threat the protagonists of My Hero Academia have encountered thus far. What makes them so strong? First of all, their members boast incredible powers - Dabi's Cremation quirk creates a hotter flame than anything else seen in the series, Mr. Compress can capture people inside marbles, and Tomura Shigaraki can make anything he touches crumble to dust.

That doesn't even touch on All for One, who has acquired so many powers that it's impossible to name them all, or the Nomu, an army of science experiments that double as killing machines.

But it's not just raw strength that works in their favor. The League of Villains specifically recruits the most desperate, unhinged people they can find and gives those people a sense of belonging. It's more than just an organization - it's a safe haven for those who have been pushed out of hero society. That's what makes them so dangerous and so powerful.

The Phantom Troupe - 'Hunter x Hunter'

![The Phantom Troupe - 'Hunter x is listed (or ranked) 11 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50113/1002248218/original/1002248218-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

The Phantom Troupe is a band of elite thieves, consisting of only the most skilled Nen users. They're responsible for a number of grisly crimes such as the Kurta Clan massacre. Their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer, is one of the strongest characters in the Hunter x Hunter universe. For one, Chrollo can hold his own against two Zoldycks. And even Hisoka acknowledges his strength through his desire to fight him. When you bring all thirteen members of the "Spiders" together, they're capable of wreaking havoc and death among an entire city. 

Anteiku - 'Tokyo Ghoul'

![Anteiku - 'Tokyo Ghoul' is listed (or ranked) 12 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775881/original/anteiku-tokyo-ghoul-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Anteiku's purpose is a noble one. It houses, cares for, and feeds ghouls who are unwilling or unable to fend for themselves. Rather than slaughtering humans for ghoul chow, they seek out people who are already dead.

Providing a safe haven while minimizing violence would be laudable enough on its own, but there's even more to Anteiku's story. Its members are more than capable of fighting off those who wish to disrupt their peaceful lifestyle, so they aren't just sitting ducks when war breaks out among ghoul society.

The Survey Corps - 'Attack On Titan' 

![The Survey Corps - 'Attack On  is listed (or ranked) 13 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775876/original/the-survey-corps-attack-on-titan_-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

The Survey Corps is a group of soldiers whose primary objective is to kill as many Titans as possible. This highly trained military unit uses vertical-manoeuvring equipment to scale the giant creatures and take them down.

Though they start off the series with a low success rate, they save countless lives and continue to learn more about what it takes to stop the dangerous assailants.

Class 3-E - 'Assassination Classroom' 

![Class 3-E - 'Assassination Cla is listed (or ranked) 14 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775885/original/class-3-e-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Class 3-E starts Assassination Classroom as a group of unimpressive middle school students. In fact, they're considered the dregs of Kunugigaoka Junior High School. They're the students with the worst grades and supposedly the least potential.

When a strange creature with a smiley-face head and tentacles claims he's going to blow up the planet unless Class 3-E can assassinate him first, the entire class believes all hope is lost. But fortunately, they learn to work together and manage to develop their talents both as a group and as individuals.

The Black Knights - 'Code Geass'

![The Black Knights - 'Code Geas is listed (or ranked) 15 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775883/original/the-black-knights-code-geass-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

The Black Knights are a group of political rebels whose goal is to free Japan from colonial rule under Britannia, a fictional nation that has a real-world counterpart with a similar name. Originally composed of idealistic teenagers commandeering mecha, it grew more powerful once Lelouch - also known as Zero - joined the team. Lelouch not only possesses intimate, personal knowledge of the Britannian royal family, he also has an incredible ability called Geass, which lets him control other people's actions.

Unfortunately, Lelouch is also more than happy to throw the team under the bus for his own benefit, which does undercut their power.

The Armed Detective Agency - 'Bungo Stray Dogs'

![The Armed Detective Agency - ' is listed (or ranked) 16 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775889/original/the-armed-detective-agency-bungo-stray-dogs_-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

The Armed Detective Agency is comprised of people who share three things in common: They're all named after famous literary figures, they all possess incredible abilities that range from transforming into a tiger to eliminating other people's powers on contact, and they've all dedicated themselves to solving mysteries.

In between solving cases, they're fighting off the Port Mafia and taking in kids who have nowhere else to go. They even go so far as to give these children jobs. This is one powerful, literary team.

The Hero Association (S-Class) - 'One-Punch Man'

![The Hero Association (S-Class) is listed (or ranked) 17 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50113/1002248223/original/1002248223-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

The Hero Association is one of the most powerful organizations in One Punch Man. Theyhave an established system and database for all of the cities' professional heroes. And within the Association resides the most elite heroes: The S-Class. S-Class heroes are the best of the best. They often act as an emergency army division when cities are threatened with disaster level monsters. From Genos to the Tornado of Terror, the S-Class heroes are formidable opponents. And while they're not as strong as Saitama, they hold their own pretty well. 

Joestar Group - 'JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'

![Joestar Group - 'JoJo's Bizarr is listed (or ranked) 18 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50103/1002041882/original/joestar-group-_jojo_s-bizarre-adventure_-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Even though the Josestar Group changes after every new segment with a new JoJo at the helm, one thing remains the same: the Joestar Group will take you on an absurd yet highly entertaining ride. From the Stardust Crusaders to the Passione gang, each group always finds creative and witty ways to defeat their opponents - all the while striking fabulous poses. 

The Yorozuya - 'Gintama'

![The Yorozuya - 'Gintama' is listed (or ranked) 19 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775882/original/the-yorozuya-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Ostensibly a provider of odd jobs services, the Yorozuya is actually a tight-knit team of characters who will do anything to help each other out. Shinpachi, Gintoki, Kagura, and their giant dog, Sadaharu, do everything from the look for an alien prince's lost pet to battle Kagura's estranged family members. Sometimes it's for money (which they'll promptly spend on idol merchandise, snacks, and strawberry milk instead of rent) and sometimes it's to help one another.

No matter what the Yorozuya is up to, it's always hilarious - and beyond the humour, there's some serious heart.

Team Rocket - 'Pokemon'

![Team Rocket - 'Pokémon' is listed (or ranked) 20 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775879/original/team-rocket-_pok_mon-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Team Rocket is the villainous organization that exists to steal Pokémon only to turn them around for a tidy profit. While viewers usually encounter Jessie, James, and Meowth - a team of thieves who can sometimes be more bumbling than intimidating - they're backed by a powerful force that has its fingers in nearly every industry in the Pokémon world.

Think the mafia, but focused more on stealing Pokémon than putting cement blocks on people's feet, and you have Team Rocket.

Hakogaku - 'Yowamushi Pedal'

![Hakogaku - 'Yowamushi Pedal' is listed (or ranked) 21 on the list The 21 Most Powerful Anime Teams Of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50089/1001775878/original/hakogaku-yowamushi-pedal-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

No list featuring anime teams would be complete without an entry from a sports anime. The Hakone High School cycling team, also known as Hakogaku, is the single most powerful cycling team in the world of Yowamushi Pedal. They're the nearly undefeated champions of the Inter-High, having only lost once to Sohoku's team. Still, Hakogaku remains formidable.

Members include Juichi Fukutomi, whose catchphrase is literally "I am strong"; Touichirou Izumida, who is so ripped that his muscles literally have their own names and personalities; Jinpachi Toudou, who is great at climbing hills and making his rival feel awkward; and Takuto Ashikiba, who imagines entire symphonies in his mind as he outpaces his opponents. They're excellent cyclists and endearing characters.
