One of my Favourite Episode of Boruto is Episode no 174 because though this episode doesn't offer any fights or drama but it offers one of the goosebump moments as  injured Mugino tack back the Feudal lord he was interrupted by the villain lady of victor as the fight about to start, 2 unknown members arrive with hoody clown, at first I thought they are the newest characters maybe be Kashin koji, but in a blink of second He defeats the lady and vanishes her and in the next moment he shows his face and turns out to be Orochimaru.

Oh my god, that was one of the best moment in recent Boruto episodes and in the further episodes, we can expect to see Orochimaru fighting with victor and Deepa to stop the Devine tree meanwhile Devine Tree grew bigger this time and it resembles the original divine tree but a smaller version of it and it is on the last stage to produce the Fruits and Boruto and Sarada encounters the Deepa again but they do not fight yets and we can expect some action scenes in the next Episode 175.

Konahamuru’s Plan
-----------------

Konahamaru stays back to stop the victor earlier and asked Mugino to Take Feudal lord to the Leaf village as proof of victors plans and meanwhile, Mugino gets injured on his right chest and Mugina tells him to not die fighting with the victor.

  

finally, this episode offers Orochimaru involving the victor's plan and we can expect more hype and chilling episodes in the future Boruto episode
