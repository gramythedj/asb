Demon Slayer: 5 Strongest Demons (and 5 Weakest)Â 
-------------------------------------------------

  
Demon Slayer has some genuinely unimaginable Demons. These are the best and most exceedingly terrible demons in the anime.  
  
In a short time, the new shounen anime Demon Slayer has transformed into the most recent wonder. The anime adjusts Koyoharu Gotouge's top of the line manga arrangement and recounts to an enthusiastic story about sprouting demon slayer(Tanjiro), who more than anything needs to save his sister(cute Nezuko) from a reviled destiny.

MJ

  
Frankly, to say Kibutsuji Mujan Uses 12 Moons called as upper demons to kill the Various Pillars(Hashiras) Regardless of their abilities, Muzan Kibutsuji himself is on an entirely another level because of how he's a Truly Pure demon. Muzan Abilities are far from better than combined moon's even beheading is head is not enough to kill him. fighting against Muzan is troublesome in itself, however, demon slayers are as yet attempting to figure out what the best system to kill Muzan would be. He stays a secretive trump card whose full powers presently can't seem to be seen.  
(Tell me if I am wrong don'tÂ  Mujan looksÂ  like Michael Jackson) ðŸ˜Ž  

Strongest: Kokushibo rank 2Â 
----------------------------

Kokushibo

  

  
There are hardly any demons that are progressively hazardous that Kokushibo. He's the Strongest individual from the 12 Demon Moons other than Muzan Kibutsuji and he's spent actually several years warring against demon slayers, learning their stunts, and idealizing his procedure. Kokushibo is a specialist in the fight, yet in the event that the entirety of this wasn't sufficient, Kokushibo is additionally the uncommon exemption that is a demon who likewise has authority over the breathing strategies that the demon slayers use. This mix of assorted aptitudes truly gets ready Kokushibo for whatever he faces  
  

Strongest: Doma rank 3Â 
-----------------------

Doma

  
On the off chance that the eyes are the entryway to the spirit, at that point, Doma is an especially unfilled vessel since his eyes contain unbridged craziness. Doma's detached appearance may bring about watchmen being dropped, yet he's probably the strongest demon under Muzan Kibutsuji. Doma is profoundly capable in battle and he's had the option to wipe out past Demon Pillars and procure remarkable notoriety for himself. Doma has done a ton of harm to notable individuals, however, perhaps the best ability is that he can kill the fatal demon poison from wisteria blossoms, which gives him an extremely favourable position over different demons.  
  

Strongest: Akaza rank 4Â 
------------------------

Akaza

  
Akaza is a horrible individual from the 12 Demon Moon that invests a great deal of energy in the shadows, yet he's in no way, shape or forms somebody who ought to be belittled. Akaza exceeds expectations in various noteworthy manners, regardless of whether it's his capable aptitudes close by to-hand battle or his ability for taking care of essential assaults. The 12 Demon Moon additionally follow a severe hierarchal framework and with Akaza close to the head of it as Upper Moon 3, he holds a ton of power above different demons. Both Tanjiro and Giyu assault Akaza immediately he's as yet ready to overpower them two.  
  

Most grounded: Susamaru rank 5Â 
-------------------------------

Susamaru

  
Susamaru may look to some degree honest at a first look, however, it's her merry nature towards battle and viciousness that makes her particularly upsetting. Susamaru appears to encounter an overwhelming joy in the harm that she does, which gives her a perilously swelled sense of self.  
The only reason I am adding her in top 5 is that the fight with Nezuko and Tanjiro made me hook to watch the demon slayer, this is where the demon slayer gets boosted in the anime
