#### Yami Sukehiro

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0JL4kzOHgxM/X-BTKUhBYoI/AAAAAAAAA-0/1LhNTflgwyYzSAkM4HKRh4MyAGF9z9UbgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0JL4kzOHgxM/X-BTKUhBYoI/AAAAAAAAA-0/1LhNTflgwyYzSAkM4HKRh4MyAGF9z9UbgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)

Nicknamed the Destruction God, Yami Sukehiro is the captain of the Black Bulls, who are regarded as the worst Magic Knight Squad due to unorthodox and unstable members, being both physically strong and intimidating to the point of giving death threats to anyone who annoys him.

Despite this aggression, he serves as a mentor to the Black Bulls, wanting them to be as strong as possible. Yami originated from another country known as "Land of the Rising Sun" before ending up in the Clover Kingdom, joining the Magic Knights after meeting Julius Novachrono despite being looked down as a foreigner by his peers.

Yami uses Dark Magic, using it to enchant his katana since his type of magic is regarded as Light Magic's polar opposite due to its slowness. His Dark Magic can also interfere with magic from the underworld, making him a valuable asset.

He also possesses a sixth sense which allows him to sense his opponent's _ki_ to predict their attack and counter, enabling him to learn of the connection between Patry and William. He is targeted by the Dark Triad for his Dark Magic, needed to create a Tree of Qliphoth.

Though he and Asta manage to defeat Dante, he is captured and taken by Zenon, with his katana left in Asta's possession. A running gag involves him suffering from constipation and threatening anyone who disturbs him on the toilet, usually Asta or Finral.

#### Finral Roulacase

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cZDmYVXGP6Q/X-BTpcBr3-I/AAAAAAAAA-8/qEtaq0PAWvsC2ZdL83qk2g8HNKooayIQwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cZDmYVXGP6Q/X-BTpcBr3-I/AAAAAAAAA-8/qEtaq0PAWvsC2ZdL83qk2g8HNKooayIQwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)

Finral Roulacase is a member of the Black Bulls. He uses Spatial Magic primarily for transport, and is a womanizer and a coward, but has recently started becoming braver.

For most of his life, he was considered by his father and stepmother as inferior to his younger brother, Langris Vaude, due to Finral not possessing offensive Spatial magic spells. Unable to handle the responsibility of becoming the head of House of Vaude, Finral leaves home and adopts Roulacase, his deceased mother's name, as his surname.

This lack of responsibility led to his carefree and cowardly personality and a fear of responsibility. Langris eventually becomes the Vice-Captain of Golden Dawn, the squad deemed to the strongest and looks down on Finral and the Black Bulls. Finral eventually starts helping out his comrades in combat as well, primarily using his power to trick their opponents and conduct surprise attacks, and his ability to manipulate and change the spatial location of his comrades as he wishes proves crucial in several of their battles against powerful opponents.

Finral was gravely injured during the Royal Knight Selection Exam by Langris, and he was saved from being killed by the Black Bulls. Upon awakening, he aids Yami and Jack the Ripper during their battle against Latry, the elf possessing Langris, and manages to partially reconcile with him.

Finral decides to accept responsibility and become the head of House Vaude and works hard to overcome his womanizing urges to become a proper husband to Finnes Calmreich, the betrothed to the next head of House of Vaude.

#### Magna Swing[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TJ_7wrTBoi8/X-BUWNefZgI/AAAAAAAAA_M/Z0tyBPbY7MI-Uu6fhsQcaOC7Z5KH_IJLgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TJ_7wrTBoi8/X-BUWNefZgI/AAAAAAAAA_M/Z0tyBPbY7MI-Uu6fhsQcaOC7Z5KH_IJLgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)  

Magna Swing is a member of the Black Bulls and is depicted as Yami's right-hand guy. Magna is a good-natured yet hot-headed delinquent who uses Fire Magic and rides his personalized broom, which he calls "Crazy Cyclone".

Though his inherent-mana is low, he makes up for this weakness by launching several low-magic fireballs with varying effects. Magna was originally a commoner from Rayaka Village near the Clover Kingdom border, abusing his power in antagonizing the nearby village of Sosshi.

He frequently fought against the village elder, sharpening his skills, before becoming his disciple, who influenced his choice to join the Magic Knights. He acts as a senior to Asta and Noelle, accompanying them on some of their missions. He and Luck are best friends and they have a competitive rivalry. He struggles to match Luck's strength, especially when Luck is accepted in the Royal Knights and he is not.

The relationship between Magna and Luck proves key in freeing Luck from Rufel's possession, and they fight alongside the Black Bulls against the reincarnated elves.

#### Luck Voltia

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GsJZxyoIumY/X-BT6PIaJBI/AAAAAAAAA_E/uO0kmoO7uCEkBuJcLngWhZaXA7u0iJy7wCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GsJZxyoIumY/X-BT6PIaJBI/AAAAAAAAA_E/uO0kmoO7uCEkBuJcLngWhZaXA7u0iJy7wCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)

Luck Voltia is a member of the Black Bulls, a borderline psychopath who uses Lightning Magic and is always smiling regardless of circumstances, giving him the nickname "Luck the Cheery Berserker."

He fights by creating gloves and boots to increase his speed and launch lightning balls. Born a commoner within Yvon Village and raised by a troubled woman before she died of stress, Luck was instilled with the notion that winning a fight is the same as being loved.

This motivated him to fight stronger opponents to test his strength, joining the Magic Knights while gaining infamy from his conduct of nearly killing an opponent in the entrance exams. He and Magna are best friends and they have a good-natured rivalry.

Later, during the raid of the Midnight Sun's base, Luck ends up being possessed by the elf spirit Rufel as a result of Patry's ritual. Luck is released from the spell after Rufel is defeated by Magna and Vanessa with Asta exorcizing the elf spirit while giving Rufel closure.

#### Gauche Adlai[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kg27VCqqLDc/X-BUsUvEg8I/AAAAAAAAA_Y/zACpakRjEC0Fk2vhqXrcWFHkLenewsLKACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kg27VCqqLDc/X-BUsUvEg8I/AAAAAAAAA_Y/zACpakRjEC0Fk2vhqXrcWFHkLenewsLKACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)  

Gauche Adlai is a member of the Black Bulls who uses Mirror Magic, augmented by the small mirror in place of his left eye, that allows him to create mirror clones of himself or another.

Gauche was originally noble years prior when his parents died in an "accident" and then both he and his little sister Marie were robbed of their inheritance by another noble who cast them into the street. Gauche's devotion to Marie, which bordered on an unhealthy obsession that gave him a sister complex, motivated him to provide for her through criminal acts until he was arrested and Marie placed in an orphanage. Gauche was later recruited by Yami while attempting to escape the prison and reach the orphanage.

Though Gauche initially doesn't get along with the squad, even making attempts on Asta's life when Marie developed a crush on the youth, Gauche eventually starts to open up to the squad after seeing Asta's determination to work as a team. Following the Midnight Sun's attack on the Black Bulls' base, Gauche ends up being possessed by the Elf Drowa (ドロワ, _Dorowa_) of the Apostles of Sephirah before Asta exorcises the elf spirit, and Drowa accepts the Black Bulls to be nothing like the barbarous humans who killed him and his sister Eclat long ago.

Having spent the duration of the possession reconsidering his view on people, Gauche truly considers his teammate's friends.

#### Charmy Pappitson

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TUGyw4tKBPk/X-BU7u7Kw9I/AAAAAAAAA_g/CKUfx0zUm349YxfM4XASfwtp4TDEbQ9ggCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TUGyw4tKBPk/X-BU7u7Kw9I/AAAAAAAAA_g/CKUfx0zUm349YxfM4XASfwtp4TDEbQ9ggCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)

  
Charmy Pappitson is a member of the Black Bulls who eats constantly and often has food on her mind, being an adult despite her childlike appearance.

While she uses Cotton Magic to usually create sheep that cook her meals, Charmy's magic has been seen to be extremely powerful as it has helped the squad out of more than one difficult situation, using a powerful binding spell, creating a giant sheep monster, and restoring people's magic, the only known spell that does so.

During the battle against Lira, Charmy learns she is of Dwarf descent as she found herself able to assume a more adult-like appearance with her sheep turned into wolves to use with her mana-absorbing Food Magic. She develops a crush on Yuno after he saved her food during the attack on the capital.

#### Vanessa Enoteca[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dKC7X1xcsgM/X-BVP5EzJiI/AAAAAAAAA_s/ezCQw_fxiokLWaZXnbYMjSgPVKNKYKbFwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-dKC7X1xcsgM/X-BVP5EzJiI/AAAAAAAAA_s/ezCQw_fxiokLWaZXnbYMjSgPVKNKYKbFwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)  

Vanessa Enoteca is a very laidback pink-haired [witch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_witchcraft "European witchcraft") of the Black Bulls. During Vanessa's childhood, she is estranged from her mother, the Queen of the Witches, when she tried awaken Vanessa's ability to alter a person's destiny by keeping her in captivity for most of her life.

After being freed by Yami, she joins the Black Bulls to forge her own path. Her Thread Magic grants her the ability to create threads too thin to be detectable to even magic, letting her manipulate people and objects on the battlefield.

Eventually, when the Queen attempts to force Asta to kill Noelle, Vanessa awakens her fate-altering ability, the Red Thread of Fate, in the form of a cat familiar which she names Rouge; it is powerful enough to negate any outcome that Vanessa does not desire, such as the deaths of her teammates. This ability defends the Black Bulls from being harmed while Rouge is active.

#### Grey

Grey true name unknown, is a member of the Black Bulls. Although initially depicted as a mysterious and massive shadowy man, Grey's true appearance is later revealed to be that of an extremely shy blue-haired girl, who uses her skilled Transformation Magic to temporarily assume the appearance of another person. Her magic also allows her to transform magic into other attributes, such as converting Sally's Gel Magic into crystals or vines.

Grey was abused by her stepmother and twin stepsisters, who forced her to do every chore. She runs away from home when her stepsisters attack her after she transforms into them to try to be accepted.

She is nearly robbed, but is saved by a runaway Gauche, who tells her not to run if she is not prepared to survive on her own. She develops a crush on Gauche when she meets him again in the Black Bulls, though he does not recognize her as she was transformed during their first meeting. She often spends time around him and Gordon, due to Gordon also having communication issues.

#### Gordon Agrippa

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OZdkWJPIirM/X-BVYuqVnAI/AAAAAAAAA_w/at76sVK6FQkJN77ej8vz7h7Z9H0TvLMKwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-OZdkWJPIirM/X-BVYuqVnAI/AAAAAAAAA_w/at76sVK6FQkJN77ej8vz7h7Z9H0TvLMKwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)

Gordon Agrippa is a member of the Black Bulls, who is very friendly and cherishes his comrades despite being misunderstood because of his pale and creepy appearance along with his whispering most of the time.

An expert in Poison Magic specifically curses, Gordon comes from a commoner family that specializes in curse magic that their ancestors used for murderous purposes. Because of this, he rarely interacted with anyone during his childhood, leading him to develop poor communication skills. He was further rejected during adulthood due to his Poison Magic, further increasing his desire for friends.

He eventually starts speaking up more with his squamates, who accept him wholeheartedly. Gordon initially wanted nothing to do with his family since their legacy caused his childhood isolation, only to learn later that his father Nathan became a healer who uses their family's knowledge to locate and treat those who are cursed, which Gordon was unaware of due to his father being a poor communicator too.

#### Zora Ideale[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sALAQgpxx1c/X-BWA6y1boI/AAAAAAAABAE/RLqR01YASfkIwqreWCCa-qAk1q9_-Vj0ACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sALAQgpxx1c/X-BWA6y1boI/AAAAAAAABAE/RLqR01YASfkIwqreWCCa-qAk1q9_-Vj0ACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)  

Zora Ideale is a cynical and often disrespectful member of the Black Bulls who uses his versatile Ash Magic in creating various trap spells against his opponents, his most often used spell being one that rebounds an opponents spell at double the strength. He is harshly critical toward those he defeats.

Zora's ideology developed as the result of the death of his father Zara, who looked up to Magic Knights and eventually joined the Purple Orcas as the first commoner Magic Knight. Zara was secretly killed by a teammate during a mission because of this. This disillusioned Zora, giving him a hatred of nobility and royalty, and made it his goal to put every corrupt Magic Knight in his place, refusing to wear his Magic Knight robe after Yami made him a member after defeating him in a battle.

He infiltrates the Royal Knights Selection Exam under a false identity for his personal agenda and constantly argues with Asta due to their drastically different personalities and worldviews.

After witnessing his bravery, sense of justice and desire to work with others, Zora is inspired to work with others as well, and decides to officially declare himself as a Black Bull member. Though he still retains some of his arrogance and continues to argue with Asta, he joins the Royal Knights and fights alongside his squad against the Eye of the Midnight Sun.

#### Henry Legolant

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GH4Warbomfs/X-BVonkOBNI/AAAAAAAAA_4/mNG0aL8Em7k5ZTjfZAR4AP8NcI7pp_dmgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GH4Warbomfs/X-BVonkOBNI/AAAAAAAAA_4/mNG0aL8Em7k5ZTjfZAR4AP8NcI7pp_dmgCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)

Henry Legolant is the actual owner of the Black Bulls' base, using his Recombination Magic to remodel the building and rooms as he seems fit.

Being bedridden due to a strange illness from birth, being born into a noble family, Henry prolongs his life with a magic absorbing constitution by passively siphoning mana from others.

This forced his family to live in seclusion in the Common Region within the estate that would become the Black Bulls' base, the building itself stabilizing Henry's mana siphoning. When Henry's parents eventually left and never returned, Henry assumed that he would die soon until he was later found by Yami, and offered him ownership of upon his death.

Yami refuses and instead tells Henry to survive as the base will soon be filled with many healthy and active people for him to siphon mana from. Since then, Henry expressed a sense of obligation to the Black Bulls.

Though he speaks very slowly and does not reveal his existence to most of the Black Bulls for a long time, he secretly wanders the base to witness the camaraderie of the Black Bulls. Brief glimpses of Henry and the rearranging building lead to a rumour that a ghost haunts the Black Bulls' base.

Asta often visited Henry in secret, as Henry's mana absorption does not affect him, due to Asta not having any mana. Revealing himself during the Eye of the Midnight Sun's attack on the base, he proves key during the battle by configuring the base into a bull-shaped form, using the mana he accumulated from the Black Bulls to pilot the base and use powerful attacks.

His sense of obligation motivated him to help the others battle Drowa, and an attempt to sacrifice himself to save them, but is rescued by his friends and is glad he can fulfil his desire to openly live with them.

#### Secre Swallowtail

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-76X5WpHhJkk/X-BUdKZvM-I/AAAAAAAAA_Q/RWlTAZw7jwQFeMV1g1GeBZrrudNm0B88QCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-76X5WpHhJkk/X-BUdKZvM-I/AAAAAAAAA_Q/RWlTAZw7jwQFeMV1g1GeBZrrudNm0B88QCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)

Secre Swallowtail is a young woman who lived five centuries ago in the Clover Kingdom as a servant of Wizard king Lumiere. She helped him perfect his magic tools with her Sealing Magic.

Secre afflicted herself with the Weg curse after she sealed the demon Zagred away from the world of the living with the magic stones as a power source, causing her to grow horns as a drawback of this Forbidden Magic.

This act altered the very nature her magic, and she gained the ability to transform into the form of an anti-bird after sealing the Prince as a stone, as a fail-safe measure, should Zagred return once again. Secre remained in her bird form for centuries before deciding to stay near Asta after encountering him during his Magic Knights Entrance Exam.

She continued to be with Asta even after he was included as a member in the Black Bulls. Upon seeing her, the other Black Bull members named her "Nero". While she was with the Black Bulls as their pet bird, she played a key role in gathering a majority of magic stones for them.

When Zagred returned after 5 centuries, Secre borrows Finral to reach Lumiere so she can use the magic stones to revive him while returning to her true form before they could join Asta and others at the Shadow Palace. She proves to be crucial when she unseals Licht's soul and seals away Asta's physical damage, allowing him to draw even more power, which proved necessary to destroy Zagred.

While Secre wanted to remain by Lumiere's side as he passes on, he convinces her to remain with the Black Bulls as an official member.

When Secre and Asta are convicted by the Magic Parliament for their involvement with devils, Yami interrupts and proclaims amidst everyone that Secre too was a member of the Black Bulls, and warns everyone to not lay a finger on her, along with Asta. This motivates her to join the Black Bulls, and she supports the other Black Bull members in their mission to investigate devils.

#### Nacht

Nacht is the enigmatic vice-captain of the Black Bulls, who uses Shadow Magic to manipulate shadows. He is able to slip in and out of any shadows, immobilize people who step into shadows, and physically restrain people with shadows.

  

He is contracted to four devils with various animal masks, one is named Gimodelo. Pragmatic, logical, and blunt, Nacht dislikes most of the Magic Knights, and freely admits to hating the Black Bulls, but works with them to stop the Dark Triad anyway, as he absolutely loathes their meaningless evil.

An associate of Yami's when they were part of the Gray Deer squad, Nacht was arbitrarily named vice-captain, with only Yami and Julius aware of his position. Nacht infiltrates the Spade Kingdom, undergoing a highly secret undercover mission.

When he returns to the Clover Kingdom after the Dark Triad's attacks, he introduces himself and Gimodelo to Asta and decides to teach him how to use a devil's power. He and Asta later visit a captain's meeting, where Nacht shares his intel, and begins plotting an invasion of the Spade Kingdom.
