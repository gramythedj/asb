In spite of the fact that he isn't exceptionally forthright with everybody he meets about hefting a demon around on his back, Tanjiro is straightforward and is practically legit of course. In his battle against Kyogai the Drum Demon, Tanjiro made a point to shout to the distracted beast, telling his rival that he was going to assault.

Tanjiro's hair remains genuinely all around kept, however, there isn't a lot of proof of an expert stylist watching out for his scalp. Truth be told, Tanjiro's first hairstyle in the series wasn't at all by decision. At the point when the Demon Hunter Giyu Tomioka showed up, Tanjiro bounced to battle for his own and his sister's lives.  
  
During the experience, Tanjiro marginally moves himself and Nezuko of Giyu's cutting edge yet gets his braid cleaved all the while. Afterwards, Tanjiro chooses to keep up the look and trims his hair himself.  
  
  

### 5\. Adjustment 

[![tanjirou](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Pmi5MnxxH78/XyguR6oyT8I/AAAAAAAACng/k2GHN-NcCBw6l8douyxAUorVdcFCVLnawCPcBGAYYCw/s640/Tanjiro_using_Hinokami_Kagura_Dance_to_cut_Rui%2527s_threads%2B-%2BCopy.png "tanjirou")](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Pmi5MnxxH78/XyguR6oyT8I/AAAAAAAACng/k2GHN-NcCBw6l8douyxAUorVdcFCVLnawCPcBGAYYCw/s1600-rw/Tanjiro_using_Hinokami_Kagura_Dance_to_cut_Rui%2527s_threads%2B-%2BCopy.png)

  
What great is realizing without applying the information to reality? Another key characteristic of Tanjiro's is his capacity to assess circumstances and think and react quickly, permitting him to hold onto triumph in his fights, and in his regular day to day existence.  
  
Regardless, Tanjiro was instructed 10 types of Water Breathing procedures by the Demon Hunter Trainer Sakonji Urokodaki. As his swordsmanship improved, Tanjiro had the option to evaluate other Breathing Techniques by viewing and with a couple of clarifications from his friends, change up his munitions stockpile.  
  
  
  

### 4\. A Calculated Risk Taker 

  
Tanjiro is brave yet not under any condition crazy. In his fight with the Swamp Demon, Tanjiro bounces directly into the pool of shadows, yet not before pulling the hijacked young lady from out of it first. His jump into the marsh could be viewed as unnecessarily brave, however, the seized young lady coming out of the bog still alive was without a doubt a sign of the potential outcomes. Tanjiro likewise comprehended the idea of the Water Breathing Techniques enough to have a successful series of assault while in the marsh.  
  
  

### 3.The Motivational Swordsman 

[![tanjiro](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8wUuOJiQwek/XyjVlr9z6oI/AAAAAAAACrA/2KEgOHe4pow4wWo9xm3mhBiwRRPHES_FwCPcBGAYYCw/s320/292fbfc61d73444701670dc6064bb61a%2B%25281%2529.jpg "tanjiro")](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8wUuOJiQwek/XyjVlr9z6oI/AAAAAAAACrA/2KEgOHe4pow4wWo9xm3mhBiwRRPHES_FwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600-rw/292fbfc61d73444701670dc6064bb61a%2B%25281%2529.jpg)

  
The immortal, man-eating demon population in the DHKNY world having the ability to increase their strength with every meal can most certainly cause thoughts of futility for those charged with fighting them (just ask Zenitsu!).  
  
  
  
Many times throughout his Demon Hunter training and missions, Tanjiro confronted his fear and discouragement head-on. Quite a few of his victories were won in spite of injuries that should’ve lessened his chances, but through his positive self-talk, Tanjiro overcomes the mental obstacles and perseveres time and time again.  
  
  

### 2.The Ultimate Big Brother

The Kamado family ends up being a solid one regardless of the deplorable occasions that discovered them. Thusly, Tanjiro's battling style, the Hanafune studs, garments designs, and even the scar on his temple are attributes shared among him and his predecessors.  
  
Tanjiro's scar changes as he travels as a Demon Hunter, yet it was at first from a consume he got because of having spared one of his kin from bringing down a light finished and consuming himself on the brow. Tanjiro's dad additionally had a scar in a similar spot, which likewise is the area of the fire mark that shows up once Tanjiro recollects what his dad educated him.
