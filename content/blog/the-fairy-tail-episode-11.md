### The Cursed Island  

Natsu, Lucy, and Happy are embarking on an S-Class quest to lift a curse on Galuna Island that turns its inhabitants into ghosts when exposed to moonlight. Gray tracks down the three to get them back to the guildhall, but Natsu beats him unconscious and takes him with them, thinking that they will escape retribution if they complete the task. After the ferryman of their boat mysteriously disappears in the middle of the route, the wizards are shipwrecked on the island and watch the local villagers transform firsthand into demons.  

While exploring, the wizards discover the frozen body of Deliora—a demon whom Gray's magic teacher, [Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fairy_Tail_characters#Ur "List of Fairy Tail characters"), sacrificed herself for to seal away—and a cult of wizards who are attempting to resurrect the demon.
