### Fire Dragon, Monkey, and Bull

Lucy is taken to the Fairy Tail guild house of Magnolia by Natsu and Happy, and she joined the guild formally. Lucy overhears Romeo Conbolt, the little boy who debates with the guild master Makarov Dreyar about his father Macao's disappearance. Romeo sympathizes with the disappearance, with Lucy and Happy behind him, of Igneel, his own father figure. Three of them face a Vulcan Creature like a monkey that kidnaps Lucy. Natsu leads the volcano to its grotto, but he throws himself outside to a gap. Lucy calls her bull Taurus to battle the Vulcano, but Natsu goes back into the cava and kicks Taurus down, which he is wrong with another beast. Natsu defeats the Vulcan and discovers it to be Macao, who the monster had possessed. After Macao is healed, Natsu, Lucy, and Happy reunite him with Romeo.Â
