Always seen sleeping even in a fight, Dorothy is revealed to be a cheery and playful person whose use of Dream Magic allows her to send her opponents into a dream dimension that she can freely manipulate. Dorothy later ends up becoming the vessel of the Elf Apostle Reve, who uses her host's powers to send some of the Black Bulls and Sally into the dream dimension. However, the Black Bulls and Sally trick Reve into dreaming up Dorothy, who engages Reve in a metaphysical battle that destroys the dream dimension before the Elf Apostle is defeated in the real world by Luck and Magna. In the aftermath of the elf attack on the Clover Kingdom, Dorothy reveals to Noelle the true cause of her mother's death.
