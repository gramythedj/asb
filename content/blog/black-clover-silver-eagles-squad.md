Nozel Silva is a royal of House Silva and captain of the Silver Eagles, a childhood rival of Fuegoleon Vermillion, possessing the ability to use Mercury Magic, free-moving, liquid metal. Nozel is one of few people who know that his mother Acier's death resulted from a devil curse. Although he deeply loves his sister Noelle due to her resemblance to their mother Acier, he keeps the truth of her death from his siblings. He pretends to resent her to keep her from becoming a Magic Knight and away from all forms of danger due to her inability to control her magic. After witnessing Noelle's progress, Nozel reconsiders with his sister before entering the Shadow Palace and subdues Patry.

#### Nebra Silva

Solid Silva is a royal of House Silva and Noelle's second big brother; Solid is a sadistic youth who enjoys insulting those he considers his inferiors, even his own sister Noelle. Since childhood, Solid relentlessly mocks Noelle and merely considers her as a shame of their family. Thus, Noelle is initially fearful of Solid but eventually exacts revenge by easily defeating him one-on-one during the Royal Knights examination. Like Noelle, Solid uses Water Magic.
