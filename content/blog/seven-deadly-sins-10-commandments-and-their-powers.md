The 10 Commandments are the strongest members of the Demon Clan. Antagonists in [The Seven Deadly Sins](https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-seven-deadly-sins/) series, the 10 members were handpicked by the Demon Lord. Each member possesses a commandment and can endue on whoever breaks it. Additionally, each commandment is immune to the other’s commandment.

  

Fraudrin – 31,000
