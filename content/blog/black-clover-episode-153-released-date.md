The Magic Knights trained daily and night to prepare for the upcoming battle with the Spade Kingdom and the Devil. Asta and Noelle are even more motivated waiting for the day to train with the Heart Kingdom’s Spirit Guardians. Yami, Finral, and Gordon show up in the middle of training of Noelle and Asta. Fin call Asta and Noelle who ask if it is the time. Yami told them that they have to go, and Fin opens his grimoire and opens the passage that will lead them to their destination.

They both landed in a lively Castle Town Kikka. Asta is happy and thanks Yami for bringing him here since it has been a year without visiting. Fin said that the town has recovered from the Eye of the Midnight Sun’s attack. On this day the annual Magic Knights Entrance Exam was being held in the coliseum. The BB squad is so excited looking at the students who are participating in the exam. Yami told the BB squad not to get involved with the exam no matter what.

The crows are chasing Asta, and the students laugh at him that he can’t handle the crow and he has a little mana. Meanwhile, Noelle met with Nozel, and she told him that Asta invited her. They want to go back to their roots preparing for the upcoming battle. Nozel reminds Noelle that it has been a year since she has left and she remembers the day she left and join the BB squad. Later they enjoy watching the entrance exam. After it is finished, Marx finds Julius wandering around and said he knew he would find him here.
