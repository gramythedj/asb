U.A. High School is widely considered to be the best academy to pursue a career as a hero in My Hero Academia. Over the years, this school has managed to produce some of the absolute top heroes, such as the former Number 1 Hero All Might himself. The current generation of Heroes at U.A. is full of students with splendid talent, with some being capable of becoming the next Number 1 Hero in the future of the series.

Among a plethora of students who train rigorously to become Pro-Heroes at U.A. High School, some tend to shine more than the others. Here are the 10 strongest students at U.A. ranked by their strength.

  

**15\. Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu **

**

  

This metallic boy is the mirror image of class 1-A's Eijiro Kirishima, and both of them get annoyed at the redundancy of it all. But the good news is that they are equally strong, not equally weak. Their quirks are simple but effective: hardening the skin. 

  

Tetsutetsu once fought Kirishima to a standstill (which is saying a lot), and he can take more than one bullet without going down. If he eats enough iron, his quirk can harden even more, and this makes him a fine melee warrior and shield for any allied forces.

  

**14\. Rikido Sato**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qwGCXXFiJwE/XzKen96kAZI/AAAAAAAAAO4/qT21NWlRFYIqnBKuux8X4d1wQGtHYinaQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/14.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qwGCXXFiJwE/XzKen96kAZI/AAAAAAAAAO4/qT21NWlRFYIqnBKuux8X4d1wQGtHYinaQCLcBGAsYHQ/s740/14.jpg)

  

While Rikodo is big and tough, he hasn't had a big moment of triumph just yet. In everyday life, this gentle giant is easy to get along with, and the girls all love his hobby of baking cakes and other sweets in his room.

  

In combat, Rikido can ingest sugar to receive a massive power boost, allowing him to smash through just about anything for a short period of time. He will experience a crash after a few moments, but until then, his strength is terrifying.

  

  

**13. ****Denki Kaminari**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wzIeBkq1nxo/XzKetUvDclI/AAAAAAAAAO8/3aKqFz9g1-87XBrZXY0L5h4413CJS674ACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/13.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wzIeBkq1nxo/XzKetUvDclI/AAAAAAAAAO8/3aKqFz9g1-87XBrZXY0L5h4413CJS674ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/13.jpg)

Denki's only real problem is that he's a bit dense and gets the worst grades in-hero class 1-A. For this reason, he operates at max capacity when a strategy-oriented teammate can give him clear directions and cues to use his quirk.

  

His quirk emits powerful blasts of lightning that can stun many targets at once, and Mei Hatsume later made him a wrist-mounted device that can channel his lightning into a narrow, precise beam to avoid collateral damage. Denki turned the tables on Seiji Shishikura (an elite student of Shiketsu High) this way. Impressive.

**12\. Ibara Shiozaki**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bb-xGlIjgZo/XzKe1F81GiI/AAAAAAAAAPA/YLKYV9C1nHYolRFUYSGHmTs5Bjym1ao5wCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/12.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bb-xGlIjgZo/XzKe1F81GiI/AAAAAAAAAPA/YLKYV9C1nHYolRFUYSGHmTs5Bjym1ao5wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/12.jpg)

  

This class 1-B student doesn't have a mean bone in her body, and she didn't like it when Present Mic suggested that she was a brutal warrior. Instead, Ibara likes to incapacitate her enemies without shedding blood, and with her quirk, that is 100% possible.

  

Her hair grows like vines, and she can rapidly extend them and move them around like tentacles to capture and subdue enemies. As she proved against Denki, she can block enemy attacks with those vines, too, making them useful both on offense and defense.

  

**11\. Tenya Iida**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6YoD9dByWRA/XzKe55cESRI/AAAAAAAAAPI/DaJH2-_IAKk1TGLhQzBKnk_1Nvhbk-PbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/11.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6YoD9dByWRA/XzKe55cESRI/AAAAAAAAAPI/DaJH2-_IAKk1TGLhQzBKnk_1Nvhbk-PbQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/11.jpg)

  

The uptight but friendly Tenya Iida is the class president in class 1-A, and he is the second-smartest student behind the genius Momo Yaoyorozu. Iida favors discipline and studying above all else, and he makes a good coach, too.

  

But he's not all talk. Iida's engine quirk allows him to sprint at incredible speeds, and he can outmaneuver most opponents with ease and take them out. He can also deliver quick, hard-hitting kicks, which he demonstrated against the mighty Shoto Todoroki during the sports festival. He didn't win that match, but he came impressively close.

  

**10\. Hitoshi Shinso**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u-IrEgygnIM/XzKe_pwItxI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/9UgvIcv_6rQBNvzBLDqTd7JTsZt4vgx6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/10.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-u-IrEgygnIM/XzKe_pwItxI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/9UgvIcv_6rQBNvzBLDqTd7JTsZt4vgx6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s740/10.jpg)

  

Shinso is a student from the General Department of Class 1-C at U.A. Making his debut during the Sports Festival, Shinso's power instantly made him a fan-favorite. He possesses the Quirk known as Brainwashing which allows him to capitalize on anyone who answers any of his questions. Under Aizawa's training, Shinso has made the usage of this ability far more impressive, and he can now use a voice changer to further trick his enemies.

  

Furthermore, Shinso's physical prowess has also reached a point where he can fight against others without relying on his Quirk, thanks to him adopting Shota Aizawa's Cloth Bind technique. Shino has successfully passed the entrance exam during the Join Training Arc and he'll now sit in the Hero Course from his second year at U.A.

  

**9\. Setsuna Tokage**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CM7b_fWdaNs/XzKfD8-SU8I/AAAAAAAAAPU/jdUnT-hmC-8HGR5tOeJ9LaE2Dj5P7TmngCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/9.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CM7b_fWdaNs/XzKfD8-SU8I/AAAAAAAAAPU/jdUnT-hmC-8HGR5tOeJ9LaE2Dj5P7TmngCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/9.jpg)

  

Described as Class 1-B's most talented student, Tokage is extremely skilled and prideful. As her name suggests, Tokage's Quirk, known as Lizard Tail Splitter, allows her to split up her body into several parts and use every part with great precision telekinetically.

  

Undoubtedly, this is a fearsome ability, and with its powers, Tokage was certain that she could defeat Katsuki Bakugo. Although she lost to him pretty badly, Tokage remains to be an excellent student, much of whose abilities haven't been completely revealed just yet.

  

**8\. Fumikage Tokoyami**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rg80sKQCLjM/XzKfII4qGmI/AAAAAAAAAPY/cmzsue_sAvkPuopZlqrQZ-elnGdXyLhoACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/8.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Rg80sKQCLjM/XzKfII4qGmI/AAAAAAAAAPY/cmzsue_sAvkPuopZlqrQZ-elnGdXyLhoACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/8.jpg)

  

One of the dark-horses of Class 1-A, Tokoyami is the user of the frightening Quirk known as Dark Shadow which gives him the powers of a strange bird-like shadow entity that dwells within him. Tokoyami's Quirk gets stronger in the presence of darkness, and weaker when there's light around. 

  

Consequently, he fails to control it properly in complete darkness, which is why he chooses to suppress his abilities as much as possible. Nonetheless, Tokoyami's abilities are certainly deadly, and although he doesn't get to show it off as much, he's one of U.A's strongest.

  

**7\. Eijiro Kirishima**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UtNWadEr1DE/XzKfM5oi53I/AAAAAAAAAPg/rzvvl_6yHVEVyVEKxj0D8gvfF6UuwLkaACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/7.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UtNWadEr1DE/XzKfM5oi53I/AAAAAAAAAPg/rzvvl_6yHVEVyVEKxj0D8gvfF6UuwLkaACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/7.jpg)

  

Class 1-A's Eijiro Kirishima is one of the brightest students at U.A. While he doesn't appear to be dangerous based on his appearance, his Quirk says otherwise. Kirishima has the power of Hardening at his disposal using which he can solidify his body to different degrees at will. Once taken to its limits, Kirishima gains a form known as 'Red Riot Unbreakable'.

  

This form of his is exceptionally fearsome and it certainly makes him a threat to any villain out there. In terms of skill, his mastery over it ensures that Kirishima is one of the strongest at U.A, even more so in his own class.

  

**6\. Shoto Todoroki**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H-W9m-W5tps/XzKfSGgNa2I/AAAAAAAAAPo/bcH6Ul2oCZoBiCgVgoVXZqQMpvHJruK6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/6.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H-W9m-W5tps/XzKfSGgNa2I/AAAAAAAAAPo/bcH6Ul2oCZoBiCgVgoVXZqQMpvHJruK6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/6.jpg)

  

Belonging to Class 1-A, Shoto Todoroki is said to be a prodigy who is already at around the level of Pro-Heroes. His father, Endeavor, made sure that he trained his skills to the point where he could, one day, surpass even All Might. Shoto's Quirk is known as Half-Cold Half-Hot and it is a perfect mixture of his mother's ice ability and his father's flame ability.

Using this Quirk, he can manipulate both these powers simultaneously and give rise to highly destructive power. Despite that, Shoto had much to learn and his control over his fireside isn't as good, which is why he's training under Endeavor right now.

  

**5\. Bakugo Katsuhi**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nrQVp4fHRfU/XzKfWkwOnZI/AAAAAAAAAPw/cwM1nRGMrB4cVH9J53VcBjyEGlFk2HfvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/5.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nrQVp4fHRfU/XzKfWkwOnZI/AAAAAAAAAPw/cwM1nRGMrB4cVH9J53VcBjyEGlFk2HfvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/5.jpg)

  

Undoubtedly one of the strongest U.A. freshmen, Class 1-A's Bakugo is a monster in terms of strength. With the aim of surpassing All Might and becoming the Number 1 Hero in the future, Bakugo joined U.A., and as expected, he has excelled ever since.

  

His Quirk is known as Explosion, and with its powers, Bakugo can produce nitroglycerin from his palms and ignite it to create enormous explosions. With his abilities, Bakugo rivals Midoriya in terms of skill, and could even be superior to him, arguably. Just like Shoto, he's training under Endeavor to become stronger right now.

  

**4\. Izuku Midoriya**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QOzkMuCzOXM/XzKfbBGZ7SI/AAAAAAAAAP4/sK-membsMhY02ognUkj0RfJQgAFw7EK7QCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/4.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QOzkMuCzOXM/XzKfbBGZ7SI/AAAAAAAAAP4/sK-membsMhY02ognUkj0RfJQgAFw7EK7QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/4.png)

  

The successor of All Might and the current user of One For All, Midoriya might just be the strongest student from Class 1-A at U.A currently. He has fought some of the most heinous villains during his time at UA, and his capabilities are only improving with time.

  

Apart from the drastic physical boost that One For All gives to him, he can also access seven more Quirks thanks to the former users of this ability. Midoriya has recently manifested the power to use his second Quirk known as Black Whips, and he's currently training to control its powers under Endeavor's tutelage.

  

**3\. Nejire Hado**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ab08ks3QvcE/XzKfg8Nc6uI/AAAAAAAAAP8/tHJIFdNZGWgvfrvM7z5gK_h8s6spQSl-QCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/3.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ab08ks3QvcE/XzKfg8Nc6uI/AAAAAAAAAP8/tHJIFdNZGWgvfrvM7z5gK_h8s6spQSl-QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/3.jpg)

  

One of the three strongest students at U.A, Nejire belongs to Class 3-A. Working under the current Number 10 Hero, Ryuko, Nejire has taken her powers to an extremely high level. She wields the Quirk known as Wave Motion, and it grants her the ability to use her life energy and emit them in the form of powerful blasts. 

  

More or less, her Quirk resembles that of Katsuki Bakugo and in the application, they're quite identical in appearance as well. Although much of her powers remain unseen right now, she displayed quite a bit of it during the Shie Hassaikai arc, and it goes without saying that she's already a Hero the Villains fear.

  

**2\. Tamaki Amajiki**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZgUQKWLRbac/XzKflfdX3uI/AAAAAAAAAQE/yzz7SGVhOrwc3JlExrE_C8IVsnleA6b3gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/2.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZgUQKWLRbac/XzKflfdX3uI/AAAAAAAAAQE/yzz7SGVhOrwc3JlExrE_C8IVsnleA6b3gCLcBGAsYHQ/s740/2.jpg)

  

Also known by his Hero Name 'Suneater', Tamaki Amajiki is arguably U.A's second strongest student in My Hero Academia. He possesses the power of 'Manifest' which lets him transform his arms and legs into anything that he's eaten prior to using it. Although this ability doesn't seem threatening, the way Suneater makes use of it is commendable.

  

As seen in the Shie Hassaikai arc, Tamaki's powers let him combat some of the most physically apt fighters. On top of his Quirk, he also possesses incredible willpower which doesn't permit him to quit unless he stands above his enemies. Undoubtedly, he's going to be a fantastic pro-hero.

  

**1\. Mirio Togata**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hQAHYyowXv4/XzKfquacLHI/AAAAAAAAAQI/7tTGVlL0-gkbQ8Z6uW-wYC08wNg7BMJGwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/01.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hQAHYyowXv4/XzKfquacLHI/AAAAAAAAAQI/7tTGVlL0-gkbQ8Z6uW-wYC08wNg7BMJGwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/01.jpg)

  

Class 3-A's Mirio Togata is, undoubtedly, the strongest of them all. His strength is such that he was openly described by Aizawa as the guy closest to All Might even among the Pro-heroes. Mirio's power is known as Permeation and it lets him slip through things at will. On the surface, it appears to be an overpowered ability, but in truth, Mirio has turned it into what it is today.

  

Even without using his Quirk, Mirio is undeniably a tremendous fighter, as displayed in the Shie Hassaikai arc. Although he's lost his Quirk, it should eventually come back to him, and hopefully, we'll see him get even stronger in the future.
