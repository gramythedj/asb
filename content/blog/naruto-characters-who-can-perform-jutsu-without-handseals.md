The ninjas in the world of Naruto rely on supernatural abilities broadly classified under Jutsu in combat. Over the years, we've seen some of the strongest users of these powers, such as Naruto Uzumaki, the protagonist of the series himself.

Among a plethora of shinobi, there are those who have perfected the art of using ninjutsu to such a degree that they don't even need to rely on handseals. Although rare, such shinobi are considered to be elite in the series. Here are 10 characters in Naruto who can perform Jutsu without hand seals.

Hagoromo Otsutsuki

Hagoromo Otsutsuki, also known as the Sage of Six Paths, is one of the characters in Naruto who was born with godly powers. Much of this is because of the fact that he was the son of Kaguya Otsutsuki, the progenitor of chakra itself. Hagoromo could manipulate any form of elemental chakra nature without having to rely on handseals, making him a powerful character in his own right.

With this power, he later went on to defeat his own mother in battle. However, Hagoromo also received help from his brother, Hamura Otsutsuki, in battle against her. Hagoromo's Jutsu were quite complex, ranging from creating heavenly bodies to breathing life into things with ease.

Minato Namikaze
---------------

The Fourth Hokage of Konoha, Minato Namikaze, was considered a prodigy among prodigies. His skill with ninjutsu was incredible, and such that Jiraiya actually considered him to be unmatched. Minato could use three nature styles; however, he rarely ever relied on them.

His signature Jutsu, known as the Rasengan, didn't need any handseals to be performed. The sole reason why he depended on this Jutsu so much was because it saved him time and helped him strike faster, which is basically what his fighting style was all about.

Naruto Uzumaki
--------------

The son of the Fourth Hokage, Naruto Uzumaki was the complete opposite of his father when it came to skill. Naruto started off quite slow, however, along the way he reached the pinnacle of strength. Naruto even developed his own Jutsu, known as the Rasenshuriken. Just like the Rasengan, the Rasenshuriken didn't need handseals to be created, saving Naruto the hassle of using them in battle. Other than the Rasenshuriken, Naruto went on to perfect a bunch of other Jutsu and use them without handseals as well.

Kaguya Otsutsuki
----------------

The progenitor of chakra, Kaguya Otsutsuki, was an extremely powerful character, and she served as the final villain of the Naruto series. Being the one from whom chakra originally came from, Kaguya possessed tremendous amounts of it, and she also had the power to use it freely.

Despite possessing several powerful Jutsu, Kaguya was never seen using any handseals, which just goes to show how strong a character she was. Truly, her strength was unparalleled in Naruto.

Kinshiki Otsutsuki
------------------

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/OupChL8k7K_290WBSkGsaFLBcf89NuEmLglCe_t5ayrNcpgbqXkoRa-R0z0kHxII_lKwUBFwHXpLT4VLb6BPtC_CcGc2ske9DbaCfaHUSQTns-umvw-ugzn3toQoYEoLpy7vneDn=s1600-rw)

  

Kinshiki Otsutsuki made his debut in Boruto: Naruto the Movie, and he partnered Momoshiki Otsutsuki as the main antagonist of the series. Being a God, Kinshiki didn't need to rely on trivial things such as handseals to perform any sort of Jutsu.

His main power was using the ability to cast red chakra into weapons which could casually even split planets. Although not the strongest, Kinshiki Otsutsuki matched Sasuke Uchiha in battle for quite a decent amount of time, proving he was no pushover.

Hamura Otsutsuki
----------------

Hagoromo Otsutsuki's brother and Kaguya's younger son, Hamura, was just as great a character as his brother. Although he wasn't focused on as much as his brother, Hamura possessed power that was comparable to him.

Hamura's case was akin to Hagoromo's in that he didn't need to draw any handseals to cast a Jutsu. This was down to the fact that he was Kaguya's son, and thus, had inherited her chakra strongly. Hamura, too, played quite an important role in the sealing of Kaguya Otsutsuki long ago.

Urashiki Otsutsuki
------------------

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MasvIL5IeSdiJVJ5QJ4yMPbyk2FMbeue2KLZkTem15Aihn0Mdm2Yz9h2SVGUXqo6mWkY4jCrgXESOThlsKUISh4rDdCFB3iYhXu4SMAdI9Dv28cF2WUs-QuYfITkqp351ngIi2dL=s1600-rw)

  

One of the members of the Otsutsuki clan, Urashiki was first hinted at during Kaguya's arc in Naruto Shippuden, but was introduced deep into Boruto: Naruto Next Generations. Urashiki, being a God, didn't need to rely on handseals to perform any sort of Jutsu. In his strongest form, he could cast powerful Jutsu of the Otsutsuki clan, all without relying on even a single handseal. Urashiki also possessed the ability to steal the chakra of other people using his fishing rod and use them freely, without performing any seals.

Toneri Otsutsuki
----------------

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ap0KrDVMTnwAovohf2Q98pmJyuiN76LFJD-GDNskffRSItrNmG0dPQo552d_7pNsVSnxERkN9u_u_Tb8lR_Ed7dWVsW76DdAJN2kPsohJXd9tDmX5zcLF7qZ0sJjlTMGCwM4exZ5=s1600-rw)

  

Toneri Otsutsuki is the last known Otsutsuki descendant of Hamura Otsutsuki on the moon. He appeared as the main [antagonist in The Last: Naruto the Movie.](https://www.cbr.com/naruto-best-worst-villains-plans-goals-ranked/) Toneri was quite strong, thanks to him having Otsutsuki chakra and the fact that he awakened the Tenseigan.

By virtue of its powers, he could use several complex techniques, such as the Golden Wheel Reincarnation, which were powerful enough to split the moon and possibly even the Earth in half. Evidently, he did all this without even creating a single handseal, showing his superiority over regular shinobi.

Momoshiki Otsutsuki
-------------------

One of the strongest members of the Otsutsuki clan, Momoshiki Otsutsuki made his appearance in Boruto: Naruto the Movie, where he fought Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha in an epic face-off. Momoshiki's ability allowed him to absorb any sort of ninjutsu from one hand and expel it from the other after multiplying it several times in power.

However complex the absorbed Jutsu may be, Momoshiki could perform it without performing seals. What's more, he could also use his own Jutsu, such as Inukai Takeru no Mikoto, without any seals.

Isshiki Otsutsuki
-----------------

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/C1dwWEClWqaA3d_BxRwrkSnnGTnSm8zDW_HEmfJbBP8RvlOajU6y-AQWOVK0JN9Qc-Xwf8vSG37uKKI7jSBfmezgC2lc_HVIsGeBrRt83IGC4BXksFCwVIjau9lf2JcZ-H60xnlm=s1600-rw)

  

Finally, we have another Otsutsuki on the list, this time, Isshiki Otsutsuki. Isshiki is the most recent Otsutsuki to appear in Naruto verse, and quite possibly the strongest. His ability allows him to reduce himself and objects around him down to microscopic sizes instantaneously, making him incredibly difficult to fight.

Isshiki, being an Otsutsuki God, doesn't really need to rely on any seals to perform Jutsu. His power was great enough to defeat both Naruto and Sasuke together, something that Momoshiki Otsutsuki failed at doing.
