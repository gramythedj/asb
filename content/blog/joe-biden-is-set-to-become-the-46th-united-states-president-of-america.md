Joe Biden is set to become the 46th United states President of America

Results of US Presidential Election 2020: Democratic nominee Joe Biden is predicted to win Michigan by the US media, picking up another state flipped in 2016 by Donald Trump and having 16 electoral votes. Meanwhile, by seeking to interrupt the vote-counting in Pennsylvania and Michigan, US President Donald Trump has threatened to drag out the final results of the presidential election. In Wisconsin, he said, he would pursue a recount, even though many other battlegrounds appeared too close to call.  

  

Trump prematurely claimed victory yesterday and said he would petition the Supreme Court to demand a stop to the counting. Biden encouraged his followers to show patience and allow the process to play out, and, by extension, Trump.  

So far, in Florida, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio, US President Donald Trump is ahead. In Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, California, Maine, Washington, Illinois, Connecticut, Michigan, Minnesota, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, New Hamshire, Nevada, and Virginia, Joe Biden took the lead.  

Biden has received 264 election votes from the states that have been called by the US media so far, while Trump has won 214. To seize the US presidency, a nominee needs to win 270 electoral votes.  

It will take days or weeks for mail-in ballots to be counted in certain states, however, which ensures that a final winner will not be declared today unless a candidate wins a landslide victory.
