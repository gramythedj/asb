## Buyer’s Guide to Thermal Imaging Camera

### Thermal Camera Buying Guide

It’s no wonder that hunters would use thermal cameras, but are they really necessary? What is thermal imaging anyway?

-   Near-Infrared
    

Trail cameras use infrared which onboard LEDs produce, to illuminate the camera’s field of view. The light the LEDs emit is typically at the low end of the near-infrared spectrum (850 nanometers – 1.4 micrometres). Visible red light is just below the bottom of that threshold, which is why a glowing red light can sometimes be seen around the emitters.

-   Passive Infrared Sensors
    

Trail cameras use passive infrared (PIR) sensors as part of their triggering circuitry. They detect the differences in the temperature of the surrounding area and the body heat of an animal passing through the detection zone. The sensor’s face is roofed during a pyroelectric material that generates electricity when it’s exposed to heat. But their cameras operate just like any other DSLR. Trail cameras see the near-infrared light the emitters cast, and that they translate that light Infrared thermography works differently.

-   Long-Wave Infrared
    

Thermal imaging devices and PIR sensor detect long-wave infrared which has wavelengths between 9 and 14 micrometres – far above that of near-infrared radiation. This area of the spectrum corresponds to the temperatures we experience in everyday life. People, animals, plant life, buildings, etc., all emit long-wave radiation. It is not incorrect to mention thermal cameras see heat, but they only see the heat that happens within the long-wave infrared bandwidth.

Unlike night-vision cameras, thermal cameras don’t detect light reflected off objects. Night-vision cameras amplify whatever small amounts of sunshine are available, albeit it’s just starlight, but thermal cameras can add absolute darkness or broad daylight. Their images are actually displays of the temperature differences in their field of view.

### How it Works

Thermal cameras detect the infrared that objects emit, but they also reflect or transfer to things. The camera’s display is not of the actual temperature of the objects in view. Rather, the camera uses algorithms to approximate all three values (reflected, transmitted and emitted radiation). The image it displays is built from those values. The infrared sensor on a thermal camera works similarly to the PIR sensors on trail cameras and motion detectors.

-   Bolometer
    

A bolometer is a sensor that detects electromagnetic radiation. It was invented by the astronomer Samuel Langley in 1878. In its simplest form, a bolometer consists of a thin absorptive element that is attached to a reservoir, which has a constant temperature. When the (typically) metal absorptive layer experiences a rise in temperature, the temperature of the reservoir rises in turn, which is detected with an electric current. The first bolometer could detect the heat of a cow from a distance of a quarter-mile.

-   Microbolometer
    

A microbolometer may be a special sort of bolometer that thermal cameras use to detect infrared Microbolometers contains an array of pixels, each composed of several layers. The outer layer is an infrared absorbing material. A space for cooling is followed by a substrate layer and a readout integrated circuit. An electrode connects the layers for transmitting detected radiation via electric signals. The whole array of pixels is then normally encased in a vacuum.

There are a wealth of materials that manufacturers of microbolometers use for the layers. Some are more sensitive than others, and of course, some are more costly than others. Another factor affecting image quality is responsivity, which is a measure of the ability of the detector to convert radiation into an electrical signal. But nothing affects image quality like resolution.

-   IR Resolution
    

The array of pixels is added up to calculate resolution. Anyone familiar with this concept will naturally assume that higher resolutions equal better images. Consumer-market thermal cameras can have as low as a 160×120 resolution or as high as a 320×240 resolution, and even higher resolutions are available if money is no object.

Having higher resolution does not necessarily equate to producing a better image, though. Smaller pixels are necessarily less sensitive, though, meaning the pictures they produce can have more visual noise.

-   Detection Range
    

Depending on the sensitivity of the materials within the microbolometer, some thermal cameras can see farther than others. Lower cost is a good indicator of shorter detection ranges, but it is not a guarantee. Ranges can extend from tens of yards for some thermal cameras to more than a thousand yards for others. Hunters should consider their terrain before investing in the ability to thermally image game from half-mile distances. You simply never have a line of sight that far in the woods.

-   Battery Life
    

Like [trail cameras](#), thermal cameras use many different solutions for their power needs. Some have enclosed Lithium-ion batteries and recharge like your cordless drill. Others use replaceable or disposable batteries. The choice of battery will obviously affect battery life, but nobody should expect to urge the months-long use from thermal cameras that trail cameras offer. The life spans of thermal cameras are estimated in hours and are based on constant use.
