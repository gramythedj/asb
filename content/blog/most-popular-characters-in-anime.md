Most Popular Characters in Anime
================================

Kazuto Kirigaya
---------------

Sword Art Online has become a behemoth within the anime world for both influencing the isekai boom that fans know today as well as rising as one of the most successful franchises in anime history. And while each member of its eclectic cast has played a part in defining the series, its main man will always be the pro gamer himself, Kirito.

Whether fans are relating to his quiet attitude or just love his various adventures within video games and romance, Kirito is filling up heart containers everywhere with his charisma.

Kurisu Makise
-------------

Steins; Gate was a pivotal and influential anime in more ways than one, but the area that really counts is in crafting one of the most famous tsundere in anime. Kurisu "Christina" Makise is the reluctant partner in crime and science to the series' lead (more on him later). Her biting tongue made for some great rapport, and her sweet side helped compliment the famous endearing quality of the series main cast.

While good on their own, these qualities gave some weight to the twist in the beginning that she may very well die in the series. Grabbing the viewers tighter as the series gone on, fans began to love and worry more and more for their beloved Christina.

Itachi Uchiha
-------------

Itachi Uchiha is the anti-hero that fans didn't think for a second was bad, as they stared into his dreamy, Sharingan filled eyes. Whether it's his iconic design, mysterious history, or cool moves, Itachi made millions of fans everywhere question why he isn't the Uchiha the series focused on.

Killua Zoldyck
--------------

Hunter x Hunter is far from being a one-character show. Even now, the series has pivoted across an entirely different perspective, giving fans awe to how versatile and complex this spectacular Shonen can be. If there was ever a character to define how cool and varied this series can be, it would be none other than Killua Zoldyck.

Though the series tries to relegate him as Gon Freecss' sidekick, Killua managed to grab a lot of attention for his mysterious family history, lethal talent, and constant contemplation of purpose and morality.

Sakata Gintoki-Gintama
----------------------

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/3xSaGin5Of_aJ7mWl_ohbk1rJH6HEwQZpyw7m19zt_w2U3_B-cS2pjrpDyNKROoAlieIjnTtplyr_jrdSolJ_R87LVS6rc_KR0i2FkdPQJZaG8NnSwlJZzp0M64CqdwBR6K3fbKf=s1600-rw)

Starting off this list is the class clown of anime who can make anyone laugh or even cry at the drop of a hat. Gintama alone is a series known as the king of anime comedy, infamous for its surreal humour, loveable characters, an insurmountable amount of pop culture references that even put Family Guy to shame.

Leading the series' motley crew of clowns is the "White Demon" himself, Sakata Gintoki. Once a revolutionary during the alien invasion version of Japan's Edo period, Gin now finds himself doing "odd jobs" across town just to make ends meet, whether it's assisting in a sushi shop, solving local detective cases, or fighting off aliens. What helps elevate Gin to this list is his ability to pull off straight-faced jokes, ecstatic straight man routines, and endearing, stoic lines, playing cool as both the humble fool and hard-boiled badass with such mastery that Gin really sees no equal within his industry.

Naruto Uzamaki-Naruto
---------------------

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/3NOY8jqApKZndJcJWfdpG8SKR_lV2Jb7v2fhJXRzmhSDBr47mikCz8lJL255-_wGkAVcdgUvfh9brb0WNz0cahB4DPV7jF7l3bUtRBYcXbEiKmYMgAPObRgAF1UEy0XgMpOraMHM=s1600-rw)

Naruto defines the very essence of "started at the bottom," as he began his journey as the incompetent outcast of his ninja school, only for the fans to cheer and cry as they watched him work and scrape to the top, training with the perviest of sages, fighting off the most powerful ninjas, and still finding time to look after his friends.

Naruto reached that rare breed of shounen protagonist that actually gets to achieve their dreams, as he finally became the 7th Hokage of the Hidden Leaf Village, making readers and viewers who followed along the way feel like proud parents.

Roronoa Zoro-One Piece
----------------------

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Y7lwKdxr9CIvcLMpheJA_N_wHX13r7ji3o7vsyXBD46cKLK5wNv_xSlHomAzp5P2BVhyakKBDJRii7R1hMr78RhxGhDp11RvbNmN2IzzIpopMilC4GvtzOrYwX6LYbihJUC0lS14=s1600-rw)

Proving that supporting characters and second-in-commands can be beloved within their own right, the "Pirate Hunter" and first mate of the Straw Hat pirates, Roronoa Zoro, makes this list. In the beginning, Zoro was just a loudmouthed kid who thought that just having more swords meant he was stronger. However, with diligent training and the pains of a lost rivalry, he'd go on to master the illustrious three-sword style and mature into the stoic badass that fans love to this day.

On his journey to becoming the world's best swordsmen, Zoro has paved (in more cases, cut) a path of destruction that has left behind buildings, robots, and some of One Piece's best antagonists. He is the coolheaded bedrock that has supported and guided Luffy as the Captain of the Straw Hats and a trusted companion that has proven to fans in more than one occasion what loyalty really means.

Rintarou Okabe-Steins
---------------------

Light Yagami-Death Note
-----------------------

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/g_KOcWchFBUSsvWRrZBI2WtI-Q1DBh5T6acV1nS9kSgtxF6F8M_sAXo1n7k1OFG8wa3vijfUvQq0LFUkKjJSYl5ypF8CshZ1oV9Dcv72lbUNaNrtBQsRq5fJ8M-7CmoM60mtuoqq=s1600-rw)

On a similar note of high concept, moral questions and suspense is the teenage saviour of humanity and punisher of all that is evil, "Kira" Light Yagami. The light was once the good looking prodigy of his high school whose societal and family pressures only made him more and more distant from the mundane elements of everyday life, until the opportunity of a lifetime literally fell at his feet, and he would begin a journey of world salvation and mass murder.

Having found the Death Note and entering a companionship with the death god Ryuk, Light now has the ability to kill anyone, anywhere by dictating their name and even cause of death within the Death Note. Taking upon the identity of "Kira," Light uses his newfound opportunity to kill all of the worst criminals of the world, showing closure to some while launching a worldwide conspiracy/mystery to others. With his genius-level intellect and eccentric passion, Light has lead fans in one of anime's greatest cat-and-mouse chases.

Edward Elric-Fullmetal Alchemist
--------------------------------

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rW2ws-3yYiFF4eoycp_LWdI7ZecqpI_3TNdgxMRXwdd4LmvYPsXc7Tt8x5jm-bNkM8ryGmX4uRmLPy14-0Elh74bfxhi5MtKBEgNGwB49mh6W1cDhI3Aed0q_PakH6XX9k25bhwG=s1600-rw)

Acting as the protagonist to one of the greatest Shounen anime of all time, the "Fullmetal Alchemist" Edward Elric has brought fans equal parts spunky, underdog passion and morally conflicted human drama that most if any, other Shounen protagonists don't achieve.

After an alchemy experiment went wrong that left him without an arm and his brother's soul trapped in a suit of armour, Ed has lead fans on an absolutely stunning journey of existential and religious drama, political intrigue, heartwarming friendships, and epic, high concept alchemy battles. Despite his arrogant, loudmouthed nature, Edward Elric was the face of an adventure that anime fans everywhere ironically prayed for a happy ending.

Levi Ackerman-Attack On Titan
-----------------------------

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Bc8BBBF8OJFetCTgbI0Jc_KGPeKQzREH-x-FRAJ8GqdeG-68U8jzC2t7wDWAVW-Y1bjPLGZ_7q_HMRkHCN3zzPgvF0vLjm15PIVXA3a1wPpFCfPlp9Eai7Er5kmvfR6AX6gN0464=s1600-rw)

Moving on to a master of blades of a different breed is humanity's strongest soldier as well as the Captain of the Scouting Legion division and the Special Operations Squad, Levi Ackerman. Since his introduction, Levi has earned more than just the fans' love, as he's absolutely taken their respect, as his role as the cold, stern-faced captain scares to near Fullmetal Jacket levels but is mitigated by his tactful nature and genuine concern for his mission and team.

Beyond a leadership that even gets viewers standing to attention, Levi is also an incredible fighter on the battleground, as he's showcased some of the Attack on Titan's most intense moments fighting off titans and other soldiers alike. Anyone who misjudges this man by his short stature may soon find themselves at the wrong end of a blade.

Monkey D. Luffy-One Piece
-------------------------

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RjjLF7GV8XWKLM009oml-LrKmHsvusK1KPcqUXBdEGAX_fN3g2JOwFFBAnGWy1v0X0C54COTlimkCVApTS1xaAH1x_sM0EvAoJPbcxphpQr9FQXJz_z25rpeiHbWVhSCPfb9ml0=s1600-rw)

The Captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, Monkey D. Luffy.  The son of an infamous revolutionary and the grandson of a beloved marine, Luffy surprisingly had humble beginnings as just a little kid looking up to his pirate hero, "Red-Haired" Shanks. After eating the Gum-Gum fruit and being raised by bandits, Luff would go on to lead his own journey to become King of the Pirates, leading a loveable crew of misfits and outcasts that have ingrained the series with tons of personality.

And no other member of that crew has more personality than the captain himself, as the fun-loving, simple-minded rubber man has made fans laugh, cry, and stare in awe, as Luffy's personal brand of justice and freedom are as provocative as they are endearing. Luffy's just a guy who's hard to hate, which falls in line with being a Shounen protagonist, but his own personal flavour promotes acceptance and dreaming in a way that other Shounen protagonists just haven't done.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

L Lawliet-Death Note
--------------------

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/QrdcpC4pbAnestNmHWdmRXDDkpdxaAyumz5gZYFfpwwQT3SiHcSt24n9114eE-Dq3Wz7xsgfTcEsOR13BlL_Ru1rCD_pFKlsYnbfpkhlJEBOzy5Ql7mwPqoUhbPxNdcU9litUURD=s1600-rw)

Surpassing his main character counterpart is Light Yagami's foil and the world's greatest detective, L Lawliet. It's no wonder that L has received as many votes as he did, as he's just an aesthetically distinct character. Whether it's his high-level intelligence, eccentric personality, off-centre posture, or sweet tooth diet, L just leaves an impression on the viewer's mind which certainly adds to the intrigue of an already enthralling suspense series.

Beyond just matching Light in intelligence, L is a perfect foil in aesthetics alone, as his social ineptitude and strange aura allow him to gun past Light's more complex strategic and social reasoning. In the battle of the kid everybody loves versus the outcast that's just hard to look away from, L oddly wins out in a major popularity contest.

Lelouch Lamperouge-Code Geass
-----------------------------

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4l5ACdeF7dnnAUwGRDRlzHhepf9WOVjzQp0ErjlZ6xjSiLToLQaeLlhxxgC-8PJeMXyJNOiwhH6wrt3D20eaaP6ocUUxl7T2UU_BkIez7Jw5iMM7e0BnEQfTDLZiXz-xRcpOwnV-=s1600-rw)

Lelouch Lamperouge was at one point a prince 17th in line to the throne who renounced his status after the assassination of his mother and the crippling of his sister. Having been a political hostage in banishment within Japan as a student, Lelouch found his opportunity for revenge and redemption as he stumbled upon C.C., a mysterious girl who grants him the power of Geass, a strange ability that lets him dictate the actions of any person once.

With his newfound gift, Lelouch continues down a path of redemption and destruction as he becomes the leader of the revolutionary group the Order of the Black Knights, lies to and betrays his friends, and kills hundreds and thousands of people in the process. Seeing what type of man he becomes as he comes out the other side is just titillating enough to bring fans across a deep moral analysis and human drama.
