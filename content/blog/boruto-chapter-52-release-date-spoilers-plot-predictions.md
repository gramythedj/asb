 ‘Boruto’ chapter 52 release date, spoilers, plot predictions

In this article, we breakdown the release date and time for Boruto: Naruto Next Generations Chapter 52, as well as discussing any potential spoilers circulating social media.

Although most fans are waiting to see how the final form of Naruto will stack up in "Boruto" chapter 52 against a completely revived Isshiki, it may not be the only one they can get. It now seems that Momoshiki has more motives for supporting Boruto, after learning more about how the Otsutsuki clan works.

Boruto, to summarise, found out that Isshiki couldn't kill him. Back in Konoha, Amado demonstrated to Shikamaru and the others that members of the Otsutsuki clan often go in pairs to a planet to plant a Divine Tree and then reap the fruit of the Chakra. 

from the Ten-Tails, which are basically a seed, without sacrificing an Otsutsuki, the process will not be successful. Amado then deduced that once his body is taken over by Momoshiki, Isshiki could intend to use Boruto as a sacrifice.

Naruto’s final form jumps into action

On the other hand, Chapter 51 ended with a cliffhanger implying that Naruto would do much of the combat in Chapter 52 of "Boruto." Kurama told the Hokage that he had to trigger one final form and it would give them a chance to beat Isshiki. However, the risk is that once he uses this form, Naruto will die.
