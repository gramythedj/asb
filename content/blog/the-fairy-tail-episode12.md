### Moon Drip  

The Galuna Island cult conducts a ritual spell called Moon Drip in order to melt the eternal ice-free Delior, which the Fairy Tail wizards claim is the source of the island's curse. Gray identifies the cult leader "Reitei" as Lyon Vastia, another of Ur's former classmates, who grieves Gray for Ur's death. After Lyon freezes much of Natsu's body in molten ice, Gray kicks Natsu down the hill to defend him and prepares to fight against Lyon. Meanwhile, Erza orders a pirate ship to transport her to Galuna Island, hoping to return her comrades to Fairy Tail for revenge.
