Asta
----

Asta is an orphan who was left under the care of a church by his mother during his infancy. He has high aspirations of becoming the next Wizard King. He possesses no magical power, but he overcame his weakness by increasing his physical strength, which allowed him to join the Magic Knight Squad known as the Black Bulls after acquiring a five-leaf clover grimoire where the Anti-Magic devil Liebe resides.

  

The grimoire allows him to use Anti-Magic effectively due to his lack of mana, later honing his senses to predict an opponent's attack by sensing their _[ki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi "Qi")_. Asta originally used the magic-nullifying Demon-Slayer Sword and the magic-siphoning Demon-Dweller Sword he acquired at a dungeon, later acquiring the Demon-Destroyer Sword at the Eye of the Midnight Sun's hideout that allows him to destroy magic's actual effects, even after the spell has been cast. This allows him to exorcise the elf spirits, should he inflict enough damage to their host bodies using it.

Asta later learns his weapons and grimoire once belonged to Elf Race's leader Licht, the book itself revealed to have demonic origins as its creation was engineered by the demon Zagreb with another demon sealed within it. After the Witch Queen used her magic to increase the Anti-Magic flow in Asta's body, he gained the ability to transform into a form called "Black Asta" by tapping into the power of the demon within his grimoire.

However, Asta later learns his power subjects him to a curse mark known as Weg that makes him a target for the Magic Parliament, who see him as a monster that needs to be destroyed. At Julius' request, he later travels to the Heart Kingdom, where he stays for six months to train and prepare for the fight against the Spade Kingdom.

Yuno is an orphan who turns out to be a prince from the Spade Kingdom's former royal family House Grinberryall. He was left under the care of a church during his infancy, acquiring a four-leaf clover grimoire and became a member of the Golden Dawn.

He uses Wind Magic and is the chosen partner of Sylph the Wind Spirit of the 4 great attributes. Sylph (nicknamed "Bell") often tries to play around with Yuno, but due to his serious demeanour, he is often found complaining. His serious attitude came about when Asta was injured defending him from bullies as a child. Yuno could only admire how Asta saved him, despite not having magic, and it made him feel ashamed. To make up for this, he trained himself to become Asta's equal in a moral sense.

His "cool" demeanour is only broken when he is enjoying himself, usually when fighting someone strong or watching Asta prove his strength. He has proven himself to be a rising star among the ranks of Golden Dawn, capable of beating even the strongest mages with little to no effort. When he is physically changed into an Elf by Patry's ritual (the soul is hinted to be that of Licht's unborn son) Yuno's magical might and willpower allowed him to retain his mind as he faced Patry and the demon manipulating him. Yuno eventually rises to the rank of vice-captain of the Golden Dawn.

He is informed of his Spade Kingdom heritage, and immediately after, responds to Zenon's attack at the Golden Dawn base, but is easily defeated and left for dead. While he survives due to William's spell, he finds half the Golden Dawn dead and is devastated at his failure to protect his friends.

Noelle Silva is a silver-haired member of the Black Bulls and the fourth-born child of the Clover Kingdom's royal family, House Silva. While incredibly powerful as a royal, possessing a vast amount of mana, Noelle initially had trouble controlling her Water Magic with her older brother Nozel acting resentful to her as his way of protecting her from both harm and the truth behind the death of their mother Acier. While Noelle used a wand as a means to cope with this magic, she learns that she has been unconsciously holding herself back out of fear of hurting anyone.

  

  

Eventually, her training and the positive feedback from her new friends in the Black Bulls allow her to overcome that flaw, displaying her full potential when fighting the elf Kevin and gains the ability to create water-based armour that increases her offence and defence. Noelle, wanting to help Asta, would later learn the truth of her mother's death being caused by a devil named Megicula. She harbours strong romantic feelings for Asta, though she is reluctant to express it.
