Episode 150 Recap

The friendly fight can have an important role in the growing relationship between Yami and Charlotte. Fuegoleon will be taking on Nozel in this fight.

Mercury isn’t much effective against Fuegoleon’s fire, so there is a little chance of Nozel winning if they fight.

All the members of the Black bulls squad have gone through immense improvement. Grey feels that she is the only one who doesn’t fit in the squad.

She wants to be herself and become strong enough to fight the Spade kingdom or the devil. So she approached Noelle to become her student.

Noelle agrees to the proposal and claims that she won’t hold back. They started by trying to get rid of Grey’s shyness. She is so shy that she can’t even face someone while speaking.

Gordon appears and tries to solve this problem with his dolls’ help, which are kept like Grey’s audience. They even suggest her to act like Asta, but none of the methods actually work, and Noelle suggests her to find another teacher.

Grey approaches Gauche for help. He agrees on the condition that she must deliver a letter to his sister, Marie.

She should transform into Marie once in a while since Gauche rarely gets any chance to meet his sister. Unfortunately, even Gauche couldn’t help her.

Meanwhile, Charlotte has started to feel for Captain Yami. She decides to do joint training with Yami’s Black Bulls squad. Julius gets inspired by this and decides to arrange for a Captain Vs. Captain competition.
