Merlin

Power Level: 4710

The reason I'm adding Merlin in is that after a lot of thought I believe Merlin is the perfect divider between the Top 10 strongest characters and the characters from the 12th strongest down. This is because she basically has the magic potential to defeat everyone that isn't on this list.

Despite Merlin's low power level, her spell effects make up for her power level entirely. With Infinity she can stop the "time" of her body and enchant her magic spells to be capable of overwhelming even the magic of Chandler in his demon form. Her intelligence is among the highest in the series, capable of finding combinations of spells to create weaknesses in enemies who have none. She has immunity to all manner of curses and resistance to brainwashing. Given 10 minutes she can stop time itself within a single area. She can create a cube barrier than cannot be broken. Absolute Cancel can negate most magic attacks. And using infinity, the simplest of her attacks can compete with the magic of top-ranked demons.

The only reason she's not on this list is that everyone on this list can at least stay somewhat relative to the base form of Sinner, who she stated was so powerful that she and those with her lost all chance of victory. Since she doesn't have any feats against anyone near his power level, she's put under those on this list. The only way she could beat those on this list is if she had preparations in place as she did against Chandler and Cusack

Ludoshel

Power Level:

Far Above 201,000

Estimated 250,000

At the 10th position on this list is the leader of the Archangels, Ludoshel.

Again, his true form doesn't have a specific number attached to it. However, while in Margaret's body, his power level was at 201,000. Nakaba also confirmed that the host bodies of the archangels are weaker than their original forms, implying that the true form of Ludoshel was far stronger.

His host form would be at least comparable to Mael with 4 commandments whose power level was "somewhere over 200,000", but more impressively he was able to block the attacks of the Base form of Sinner and damage him afterwards, making him relative, or even stronger than Base Sinner.

This plus a healing factor and some of the highest speeds in the series makes Ludoshel #10 easily. However, he isn't higher on the list because most, if not all, characters on it can defeat him, especially since his major focus is magic but not physical strength.

Zeldris

Power Level: (61,000- Demon kings power)

He's up this high because Power Levels really aren't everything. With the magic of the demon king on his side, he's capable of absorbing all manners of magical attacks without damage to himself.

His spell, Ominous Nebula, is one of the strongest attacks within the series, being capable of using his darkness to spin around him so fast that it creates a vacuum, sucking all things within a certain area towards him, where he destroys it with his blade and darkness. Almost nothing is capable of bypassing the ominous nebula to reach him.

However, the reason he isn't higher on the list is that there are a few characters on higher positions of the list who have beaten him and those who can theoretically beat him. Yes, he did end up beating the "Grieving Sage" and the "Fleeting Hermit" which were part of Meliodas/Demon King's power. But we don't know how powerful those beings were, and considering Ludoshel was able to block them a few times, their attacks weren't so impressive that others on the list couldn't do the same.

King

Power Level:

Far Above 200,000

Estimated 250,000+

King received a high enough boost within this arc to put him as the 8th strongest person in the SDS universe.

Against a Mael with 4 commandments, he destroyed him with ease. And after doing so, against Sinner he was able to damage Sinner's shield and fight fairly evenly against Zeldris and Sinner despite only being limited to using one form of Chastifol at a time due to him being far away at the time. Yet his new form allows him to use ALL the forms of Chastifol at once, making him capable of doing a LOT.

This implies that had he been at full energy and closer instead of far away, he'd be able to defeat Sinner and/or Zeldris.

As for what he can do against Ominous Nebula, his Guardian Form would count as a physical attack along with the actual staff, or at least magical attacks that Zeldris would be incapable of absorbing with his magic ability. Also King has Pollen Garden to defend himself, a defensive form of Chastifol which heals him and which was capable of tanking sword slashes from a Zeldris who's power grew enough to harm Mael, as well as the Purgatory winds, spell of the Demon King, all while his energy was low.

So theoretically King could shield himself from Ominous Nebula while having attacks possibly capable of breaking the spell altogether.

Power Level:

Unknown

Estimated 275,000+

There's a lot of controversy about how strong The One form of Escanor truly is.

For one I felt like he was worth putting on the list in this form because his power is based on various forms based on the time of day. Although weaker characters can negate this changing the time of day, it doesn't make them stronger than the form itself, which is why it's time to talk about how strong this form is and isn't.

Some say that the form of Escanor is "Infinite" in power level because in one of the translations of the second databook his power level was listed as "Unmeasurable". This seems supported by Escanor being stated as "The invincible incarnation of power" but there's a few problems with this.

If his power level was infinite he wouldn't struggle against Ominous Nebula, he would have killed Meliodas, the Supreme Deity who created his grace is relative to the demon king, who has a limit, and once Merlin stated he used most of his energy in the attack that defeated Meliodas that implies that his power level is finite. "Unmeasurable" isn't definitive, but it likely means that it's hard to measure since it changes so frequently that it's inconsistent.

Yet The One form is on a completely different level of power in comparison to his first boost to 114k. Within that form, he's capable of holding his own against Assault Mode Meliodas and Sinner for a short period of time. This implies that within The One form, he's capable of defeating The Sinner's base form easily since the form that Sinner defeated was not The One Form. The statement where he implies it is The One form is a mistranslation, which the original translation corrects by pointing out that the form that was trading blows with Sinner making him lift his guard just to block his magic, was all the form of Escanor that was far weaker than The One.

However, his strongest feat which puts him above the others on this list, instead of just being relative to them, is him being so powerful that he is completely unaffected by Zeldris' Ominous Nebula, the vacuum that sucks in all including King. While we can assume King's power can outmanoeuvre Ominous Nebula and can likely break it, Escanor with the strength of his body can do so with energy left to spare, and ignore the spell's effects completely, implying that he is stronger than King and Zeldris.

\[Spoiler ahead\] Escanor's One power is capable enough to fight Demon king and on one occasion even defeated Demon Meliodas(not full power)

Sinner/Indura Monspeet/Indura Derieri

Power Levels:

Unknown

350,000+

And now for the talk of the town himself. The one used to help scale all of this. #6 on the list, Sinner.

On this spot are also the Indura forms of Monspeet and Derieri, because I think that Sinner at full power could potentially be just as powerful as them if not stronger and I didn't want 3/10 of these spots to be similar demons who are all nearly equal in power.

The Sinner is this high up on the list because of his magic ability "Crisis", where he gets stronger and stronger the more damage he takes. This is important because Sinner in his base form has fought back King's spear, Escanor's 114k form, and made Merlin feel an inability to win more so than the combination of Chandler, Cusack, and Zeldris. After being damaged by one attack from Ludoshel he was capable of bypassing Ludoshel's defences with an attack of his own, who was previously capable of absorbing his attacks. Meaning Sinner not only was capable of defeating Ludoshel there but can get even stronger over time or if he's further injured by another attack. So this is considering him at his highest possible power level.

The Indura are on this level as well because they casually tanked Ludoshel's attacks without a scratch, causing his to bleed with a simple attack, which is equal if not more effective than the Sinner that faced Ludoshel.

Elizabeth

Power Level:

Unknown

Estimated 450,000+

The next on the list may be surprising due to her pacifism, but just because she doesn't wish to use her power doesn't mean she doesn't have a TON of it.

Elizabeth is the 5th strongest character in the anime because of her biggest feat, a light attack capable of effecting two Indura beast transformations at once. Though the spells were not offensive, it shows the difference in magic ability between Ludoshel and her due to the fact that offensive or not, Ludoshel's magic wasn't capable of actually doing anything to the Induras.

Yet her magic not only affected them, but it also pushed them both to the point that they both needed to transform to an even stronger form to even compete with her magic, making her run low on magic until she was aided by Sariel and Tramiel. Meaning that the spot needed to transform into even stronger beings in order to resist her magic, AND this was against two at once. Implying that even if one of them transformed further if it was one vs one, then she'd likely be able to beat them.

The difference in magic ability is important because she still has offensive magic. All this means is that her offensive magic is likely VASTLY superior to Ludoshel's, and the fact that she stunned Assault Mode Meliodas with offensive magic and was comparable in rank to Mael increases credibility to that scaling.

Mael

Power Level:

Unknown

Estimated 500,000+

Mael's feats are pretty straightforward since his main tactic is just to go towards the opponent and casually make them regret all their life choices within a few seconds.

He's defeated a buffed version of the Original Demon, Sinner...in one attack.

He's surpassed Ludoshel, the leader of the Archangels.

The Sunshine ability grants his body heat so great it melts Zeldris' sword simply from being near it, something The One Escanor couldn't do with direct heat.

He then went on to join Escanor in making sure that Zeldris will forever have nightmares about fingers for the rest of his life.

Now based on what I said about Elizabeth, they both seem fairly even in power level.

But here's the thing.

This. Wasn't. Even. Noon.

He can get a FAR larger boost, making his full power WAYYYY higher than anyone of lower rank on this list because his power peaks at noon, just like Escanor.

Ban

Power Level:

Unknown

Estimated 600,000-700,000+

###  The only Reason Bans Power level is because he survived more than 60000 years in the Purgatory and fought with the demons alongside Meliodas

And here comes the massive gaps in power level.

Mael in the same form was incapable of harming the Demon King, and one shot from the demon king took him out of the fight right away.

Yet Ban, the third strongest being in the NNTverse, comes in and tanks quite a few shots, bypassing the demon king's defence to actually be the first to harm him.

Yes he's no longer immortal and yes Meliodas' emotions did help him later in the fight when it came to surviving against the demon king, but early in the fight, Meliodas' emotions hadn't arrived yet.

And even if we assume they did arrive, then that only means that Mael, King, and Diane combined even with Meliodas' inner help wasn't able to do anything, yet Ban still was, making his feats still impressive.

And all of this was WITHOUT his Hunter's Fest or Zero Sign. Now that his body is far more durable, he's capable of absorbing a LOT more physical energy, thus this isn't him at his strongest.

Demon King/ Supreme Deity

Power Levels:

Unknown

Estimated 800,000+

The Demon King surpasses Ban at his weakest and at his strongest, it's not even a contest.

But since we never got to SEE the demon king pre-power split, let's go with the one currently in purgatory.

And yes, the Supreme Deity can be assumed to be relative to the Demon King which is why I lumped her in.

The Demon King is capable of absorbing and reversing the effects of all attacks.

If an attack were to hurt him, it heals him.

If magic were to heal him, it hurts him.

He is far stronger than the combination of Wild, Ban, and Meliodas' Emotions.

Also, it's worth mentioning that the Demon King is stronger than Meliodas' Emotions because the Emotions only defeated the soul of the demon king which possessed Meliodas' body. Thus it was a weaker version of the Demon King that was defeated outside of purgatory.

So the emotions of Meliodas could put up a fight against the demon king in purgatory because they're relative in power, but at the end of the day, the Demon King surpasses him.

Ban is weaker than the Emotions of Meliodas, that makes the Demon King faaaar stronger than Ban.

Meliodas

Power Level:

Unknown

Estimated 1,750,000

And at long last, everyone's favourite bar owner and the least favourite chef make the #1 spot on the list.

Can he beat Ban in a cook-off?

Probably not.

However, Meliodas is by far the most powerful being in the entire series.

He's capable of reflecting magic attacks at double the power, cancelling magic abilities, creating 5 clones, compressing dark aura into tiny balls capable of blocking the attacks of the demon king's soul and killing him.

And there's more.

Meliodas is capable of taking the form which contains all 10 commandments.

It may be a stretch to say that he has all of the commandment's effects, but this is still an important detail.

For Meliodas' emotions are relative to the Demon King not only because he reflected some attacks but because the power of the demon king is so great that he cannot stay within Britannia or likely risk destroying it. The fact that Meliodas' innate magic gives his emotions only a boost that the Demon King states would make him unable to stay in Britannia, implies that the emotions of Meliodas after activating the magic would have power close enough to the demon king that it would cause that effect.

Also, once upon a time, the demon king split half of his power into 10 pieces, which are the ten commandments. Which are all merged within the form of Meliodas' physical body.

This means that since the demon king in purgatory contains the other half, Meliodas' physical body is half the demon king's power and his emotions are close in power to the other half of the demon king's power.

Add this with the power Meliodas had before even getting any of these boosts, and we can assume that Meliodas' current power in Ten Commandments form is at least TWICE as powerful as the current demon king, and even with demon king's original power, perhaps even stronger.
