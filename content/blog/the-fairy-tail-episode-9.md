### Natsu Devours a Village

When Clover returned home, the hungry Fairy Tail wizards came across a desolate village with freshly cooked food lying about. Erza suspects something amicable and sends others to collect mushrooms in the surrounding woodland, resulting in giant mushrooms sprouting from Natsu, Gray, and Happy's heads after the three eat them. Meanwhile, Erza and Makarov uncover a magic circle that makes everything in the village into giant creatures that the wizards are attempting to eat, only to find them inedible. When they are almost devoured, Makarov removes the spell and frees the villagers stuck within the creatures.
