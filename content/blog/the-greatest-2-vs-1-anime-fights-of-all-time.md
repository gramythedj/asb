Naruto & Sasuke Vs. Momoshiki — 'Boruto: Naruto The Movie'

![Naruto & Sasuke Vs. ... is listed (or ranked) 1 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667944/original/naruto-and-sasuke-vs-momoshiki-boruto-naruto-the-movie-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

The hot-blooded rivalry between Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha defines the Naruto franchise, so when they team up against Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki in Boruto: Naruto the Movie, the result is an appropriately explosive battle. For long-time fans, there's nothing more satisfying than watching these former rivals combine their power to form one hell of a monster.

  

Goku & Frieza Vs. Jiren — 'Dragon Ball Super'

  

![Goku & Frieza Vs. Ji... is listed (or ranked) 2 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667941/original/goku-and-frieza-vs-jiren-dragon-ball-super-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

With the fate of Universe 7 in their hands, Goku and Frieza don't hold back against Jiren in the series finale of Dragon Ball Super. Despite the duo's bad blood in Dragon Ball Z, Goku and Frieza come together to throw down in perfect unison. Watching Goku rocket towards Frieza to help him defeat Jiren once and for all is one of the most intense and resonant moments in the franchise.

  

Ed & Al Vs. Scar — 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood'

  

![Ed & Al Vs. Scar — '... is listed (or ranked) 3 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667947/original/ed-and-al-vs-scar-fullmetal-alchemist-brotherhood-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood's greatest strength is its the ability to demonstrate the frailty of the Elric brothers. Their perilous encounter with Scar is a perfect example of this, as he nearly destroys them with a wave of his hand. The second time around, Ed and Al keep Scar on the run, so he can't get close enough to deconstruct them.

  

Mikasa & Levi Vs. Female Titan — 'Attack On Titan'

  

![Mikasa & Levi Vs. Fe... is listed (or ranked) 4 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667977/original/mikasa-and-levi-vs-female-titan-attack-on-titan-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Mikasa and Levi's assault on the Female Titan in Attack on Titan takes the show's already larger-than-life battles to an even grander scale. As always, Mikasa displays incredible combat skills against the Titans. However, Levi steals the shows with his lightning-fast swipes that make him resemble a flying buzzsaw blade.

  

Reigai Kyoraku & Ukitake Vs. Yamamoto — 'Bleach'

  

![Reigai Kyoraku & Ukitake Vs. Y is listed (or ranked) 5 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667950/original/reigai-kyoraku-and-ukitake-vs-yamamoto-bleach-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

In the heated match against Reigai Kyoraku and Ukitake, Shigekuni Yamamoto-Genryūsai proves he's one of the greatest captains in Bleach. The awesome power of Yamamoto's Bankai, the Zanka no Tachi, gives the two traitorous Soul Reapers a direct ticket to Hell. Yamamoto's fiery cyclone attack displays the fury of the Zanka no Tachi in a mesmerizing fashion.

  

Goku & Piccolo Vs. Radditz — 'Dragon Ball Z'

  

![Goku & Piccolo Vs. Radditz — & is listed (or ranked) 6 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667940/original/goku-and-piccolo-vs-radditz-dragon-ball-z-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Dragon Ball Z starts off with a bang. In an epic match-up, Goku and Piccolo join forces to take down a mysterious Saiyan named Radditz. Unfortunately, even their combined might is not enough to overcome the warrior. You can feel Goku's ribs cracking as Radditz stomps on him repeatedly near the end of the match.

  

Luffy & Law Vs. Doflamingo — 'One Piece'

  

![Luffy & Law Vs. Doflamingo — & is listed (or ranked) 7 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667938/original/luffy-and-law-vs-doflamingo-one-piece-photo-u3?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

If there's one villain in One Piece who deserves a punch in the gut, it's Donquixote Doflamingo. Thanks to the Devil Fruit powers of Trafalgar Law, Monkey D. Luffy finally gets the chance to do just that. Luffy's Gum-Gum Red Hawk attack lands dead-centre in Doflamingo's stomach, which looks painful, but is oh so satisfying.

  

Chiyo & Sakura Vs. Sasori — 'Naruto Shippuden'

  

![Chiyo & Sakura Vs. Sasori — &# is listed (or ranked) 8 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667942/original/chiyo-and-sakura-vs-sasori-naruto-shippuden-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

Sakura Haruno often got the short end of the stick in Naruto, but Naruto Shippuden gives the heroine her moment in the spotlight. With the help of Chiyo, Sakura survives a vicious fight against Akatsuki member Sasori. The entire battle is an adrenaline rush, as Sakura has to stay constantly on the move to keep ahead of Sasori's never-ending waves of demonic puppets.

  

Jin & Mugen Vs. Kariya - 'Samurai Champloo'

  

![Jin & Mugen Vs. Kariya - &#39; is listed (or ranked) 9 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667954/original/jin-and-mugen-vs-kariya-samurai-champloo-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Throughout its run, Samurai Champloo portrays Jin and Mugen as unstoppable killing machines. Towards the end of the anime, a swordsman named Kagetoki Kariya nearly kills the two and makes it seem easy. It's shocking to see Jin and Mugen scramble to keep up with the mysterious hired gun.

  

Gon & Killua Vs. Gaki — 'Hunter x Hunter'

  

![Gon & Killua Vs. Gaki — &#39;H is listed (or ranked) 10 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667939/original/gon-and-killua-vs-gaki-hunter-x-hunter-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Gon and Killua maybe kids, but they make a perfect team in Hunter x Hunter. Their battle against Gaki in Hunter × Hunter: The Last Mission proves just how powerful they are. Gon and Killua tease Gaki throughout the fight, before unleashing spectacular attacks like the Jajanken, making the whole encounter an absolute blast to watch.

  

Soul & Maka Vs. Jack The Ripper – 'Soul Eater'

  

![Soul & Maka Vs. Jack The Rippe is listed (or ranked) 11 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667945/original/soul-and-maka-vs-jack-the-ripper-soul-eater-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

The bond between weapon and master is on full display in Soul Eater, as Maka and her living weapon Soul obliterate the serial killer Jack the Ripper. Despite the frantic atmosphere, Maka deflects every one of Jack's wild attacks. To finish the fight, Maki lands a deadly final blow that causes Jack to explode in a dazzling display of skill.

  

Ryuko & Satsuki Vs. Ragyo — 'Kill la Kill'

  

![Ryuko & Satsuki Vs. Ragyo — &# is listed (or ranked) 12 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667990/original/ryuko-and-satsuki-vs-ragyo-kill-la-kill-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

It's mother versus her daughters in Kill la Kill as Ryuko and Satsuki go up against Ragyō Kiryūin. The rekindled relationship between Ryuko and Satsuki gives them enough power to take on their mom, and the duo's fighter jet transformation is a brilliant way to move the fight against Ragyō to the skies. 

  

Lucy & Natsu Vs. Kain — 'Fairy Tail'

  

![Lucy & Natsu Vs. Kain — &#39;F is listed (or ranked) 13 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667980/original/lucy-and-natsu-vs-kain-fairy-tail-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Lucy and Natsu take on a hideous oaf with voodoo powers in this strange yet entertaining Fairy Tail fight. Poor Lucy has no free will, as Kain Hikaru controls her every movement with a voodoo doll. Watching Natsu use the voodoo doll to make Lucy defeat Kain in a goofy way is hilarious.

  

Tanjiro & Nezuko Vs. Rui - 'Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba'

  

![Tanjiro & Nezuko Vs. Rui - 'De is listed (or ranked) 14 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50107/1002131600/original/1002131600-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Tanjiro and Nezuko's battle against the spider demon Rui marks the series' most spectacular fight. The animation was stunning as Tanjiro used his technique, Dance of the Fire God, for the first time, displaying brilliant flames that easily cut through Rui's steel threads. Plus, this fight also marked Nezuko's first time using her Blood Demon Art. Up until this point, Rui was Tanjiro's strongest opponent. And the siblings both gave it their all, proving that their bond is truly unbreakable. 

  

Deku & All Might Vs. Wolfram - 'My Hero Academia: Two Heroes'

  

![Deku & All Might Vs. Wolfram - is listed (or ranked) 15 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50107/1002131628/original/1002131628-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

In the movie My Hero Academia: Two Heroes, teacher and student join forces to defeat Wolfram and his Quirk Amplification Device. In the series, we rarely get to see Deku and All Might fight together, so this fight proved to be a real treat as fans witnessed how strong both of them were together. Plus, who could forget that epic moment when they combined their powers to use Double Detroit Smash?

  

Rogue & Sting Vs. Natsu - 'Fairy Tail'

  

![Rogue & Sting Vs. Natsu - 'Fai is listed (or ranked) 16 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50107/1002131609/original/1002131609-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

During the Grand Magic Games, Natsu decides to take on the Twin Dragons alone without Gajeel to prove his strength. And he doesn't disappoint. This fight shows fans just how far Natsu has come as it becomes a one-sided beatdown where Natsu easily takes the win.

  

Atsushi & Akutagawa Vs. Francis — 'Bungo Stray Dogs'

  

![Atsushi & Akutagawa Vs. Franci is listed (or ranked) 17 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667952/original/atsushi-and-akutagawa-vs-francis-bungo-stray-dogs-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Bungo Stray Dogs gives Dragon Ball Z a run for its money, as its outlandish fight scenes are masterfully choreographed. When Atsushi and Akutagawa join forces to take on Francis, pure chaos ensues. Akutagawa uses his coat to create a giant fist for Atsushi to punch Francis with, which sounds outrageous but is so much fun to watch.

  

Asta & Yuno vs. Licht - 'Black Clover'

  

![Asta & Yuno vs. Licht - 'Black is listed (or ranked) 18 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50112/1002230326/original/1002230326-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

In Black Clover's most intense arc yet, Asta and Yuno take on Licht together. It's an explosive fight that will have you at the edge of your seats. From Licht stealing Asta's Demon-Dweller Sword to Yuno putting his trust in Asta, this battle is both exhilarating and emotional. Although Licht wins the fight, Asta and Yuno prove that nothing can come between the true power of rivals. 

  

Silva & Zeno Vs. Chrollo - 'Hunter x Hunter'

  

![Silva & Zeno Vs. Chrollo - 'Hu is listed (or ranked) 19 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50112/1002230313/original/1002230313-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

A battle between two Zoldycks and the leader of the Phantom Troupe? We expect only amazing things from a fight like that. And luckily, it doesn't disappoint. When Zeno and Silva finally find Chrollo in Yorknew City, they showcase their deadly skills in a thrilling fight. The battle ends without a clear victor thanks to Illumi's call. But it's clear by Silva and Chrollo's stare down that we can expect another rematch sometime in the future. 

  

Canti & Haruko Vs. Enemy Robot #5 – 'FLCL'

  

![Canti & Haruko Vs. Enemy Robot is listed (or ranked) 20 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667968/original/canti-and-haruko-vs-enemy-robot-_5-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

There's so much crazy, tag-team action going on in FLCL, it's hard to single out one fight. Nonetheless, Canti and Haruko fighting a giant gun-themed robot in episode 5 are amazingly memorable. Haruko gracefully surfing through the robot's rain of gunfire and Canti piercing the enemy with his bass guitar are among the best moments in the series.

  

Masamune & Yukimura Vs. Nobunaga — 'Sengoku Basara: Samurai Kings'

![Masamune & Yukimura Vs. Nobuna is listed (or ranked) 21 on the list The Greatest 2 Vs. 1 Anime Fights of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50084/1001667988/original/masamune-and-yukimura-vs-nobunaga-sengoku-basara-samurai-kings-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Sengoku Basara: Samurai Kings makes history seem fun by pitting overpowered warriors against each other. The best fight involves Masamune & Yukimura's overblown assault on the dark lord Nobunaga Oda. In a spectacular finale, the two crash down from space to demolish Nobunaga and his entire palace.
