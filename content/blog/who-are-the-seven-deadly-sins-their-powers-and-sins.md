Who Are The Seven Deadly Sins their Powers and Sins
===================================================

A group of knights who work under the Kingdom of Liones are the Seven Deadly Sins. -- one carries a serious sin which they have committed in the past normally its basically not a real sin but they were named after their deeds

The Seven Deadly Sins, made up of the strongest Holy Knights in the Kingdom of Liones, were created to shield all of Britannia from the resurrection of the Ten Commandments, following the vision of the King of Liones. Every Sin is named after the moral failure of the crimes of which they have been convicted and bears on their skin the symbolic mark of a beast.

-------------------------------

The eldest son of the Demon King, the former head of the Ten Commandments, is Meliodas, the Dragon's Sin of Wrath, and the captain of the Seven Deadly Sins. Meliodas, betraying the Ten Commandments, cuts ties with the Demon race to seek his love for Elizabeth, a member of the race of the Goddess.

Meliodas is an almost invincible power, armed with his Holy Treasure, Lostvayne's Demon Sword, and his unique Full Counter skill, which allows him to focus on the attacker's incoming magic attacks.

In the Kingdom of Liones, Escanor, Lion's Sin of Pride, is the greatest Holy Knight. The cursed child was thrown out of his royal family, seen as a freak for his gift of inhuman power.

Accused of destroying the cities he had supported, the King of Liones was disrespected by Escanor and was given the Sin of Pride.

Equipped with the Holy Axe Rhitta, his Sacred Treasure, and his special skill, Sunlight, Escanor is the strongest human being alive. Sunshine is a blessing conferred by the Supreme God upon the Archangel, Mael, and passed on to Escanor. The power of Escanor rises to unfathomable levels from sunrise, peaking at high noon. In the incarnation of his strength, he becomes invincible, but as night falls, it subsides.
