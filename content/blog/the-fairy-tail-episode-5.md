### The Wizard in Armor

Erza Scarlet, Fairy Tail's toughest female sorcerer, and discipliner returns to the guild following a lengthy absence. To the guild's horror, Erza hires Natsu and Gray to help her deter the dark guild Eisenwald from retrieving Lullaby, a demon flute that murders all those who hear her music; the guild's administrator, Mirajane Strauss, begs Lucy to prevent Natsu and Gray from battling and angering Erza. Arriving in the town of Onibas, Natsu was mistakenly left on the train and attacked by Kageyama, a shadow wizard from Eisenwald. Unable to fight back because of his motion sickness, Natsu caught a glimpse of Lullaby before his friends saved him. Kageyama delivers Lullaby to Eisenwald, Grigor, who decides to use the flute as part of the assassination plot.
