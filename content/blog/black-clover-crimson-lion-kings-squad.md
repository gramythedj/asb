 The Crimson Lion are a Magic Knight Squad with close ties to House Vermillion, whose lineage dates back to the foundation of the Clover Kingdom and genocide of the Elves. One branch of the family's siblings is known for their red hair, desire for strength, and skill in Fire Magic. The other branch is known for its orange hair, conflicting personalities, and skill in nature-based magic.

Fuegoleon Vermillion is a royal of House Vermillion and the captain of the Crimson Lion Kings who uses large-scale, powerful Fire Magic. He does not have the arrogant attitude of most royals, possessing a strong sense of justice and enjoying helping others grow stronger, regardless of status. Before the events of the story, he declared his intent to become Wizard King with many believing him to be powerful enough to also become king of the Clover Kingdom if he wanted. However, targeted by the Eye of the Midnight Sun, Fuegoleon encounters Patry while being teleported to the elf's location after ending Rades' attack on the capital. He was sent back to the city in a comatose state after being critically wounded, with his right arm ripped and the magic stone in his possession taken by Patry, who woke as he rejoined the Magic Knights during the elves' assault on the capital. Using his magic to create a flame-based artificial limb, Fuegoleon later acquired the Fire Spirit Salamander after it left Fana, making him more powerful.

Leopold Vermillion is a royal of House Vermillion and a member of the Crimson Lions, he is Fuegoleon and Mereoleona's younger brother, who uses Fire Magic as well and has aspirations of becoming Wizard King. He adopts his siblings' ideology of judging people by their strength, personality, and desire to grow, not status. Though he feels inferior to his siblings’ strength, he continues to work hard to create a strength different from theirs. After seeing Asta's battle prowess, he considers himself his rival and friend, which is later reciprocated by Asta.

Mereoleona Vermillion is a royal of House Vermillion and Fuegoleon and Leopold's elder sister, taking over for the former following his injuries. She believes strength is everything, and unlike most royals, judges people based on their strength, not status. Known as the "Uncrowned, Undefeated Lioness", she uses Fire Magic, and due to much time spent solo training in the wild, is skilled in using natural mana. She has mastered a technique called Mana Zone, allowing her to manipulate the mana in her surroundings rather than through her body, using powerful punches from anywhere. She is undefeated in combat. Mereoleona is very aggressive and often uses violence against her own squad. She is also the current commander of the Royal Knights, and serves as a sort of mentor to Asta, due to their fighting styles involving close combat.
