### Why Naruto is the Best Anime? 

  
[Naruto](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki) is the best. Let me explain. First, it's now not possible to enjoy Naruto the same way as it was for people who grew up with it. It starts off Little childish that you can enjoy only as a person under 16. And then gets serious. So if you're older and start to watch your first impression will be that its pretty cliche. If you're younger stories will get boring fast as in fewer fights.

Naruto introduces almost all of its main characters. These characters are the characters that fans will be going through the series alongside, and due to the nature of the series beginning with childhood and ending with adulthood, growing with as well.  
Now I'm to point at which someone says they have watched whole Naruto series and liked it, I automatically assume they are not stupid and likely not gonna support injustice.  
  

### Why [naruto](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Naruto_Uzumaki) is better than [one piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece)?

  

  
Both of the stories are amazing. But if you see closely Naruto is a linear story and One piece is endlessly expanding every direction. Basically, this: Kishimoto creates more interesting characters, along with better art. Now part 2 may have dropped the ball a bit, but it's still leagues ahead of One Trash. Oda is basically the opposite. Boring story, two-dimensional characters, bad pacing, sloppy art, it's just crap.  
  
Naruto did a great job when it comes to developing a character in time to time. Luffy is almost the same as the first episodes, but Naruto really develops over time and all the others too. Both of the series is full of detail. But I think Naruto is a little bit deeper with the details of the Powers and fighting sequences.

### Why naruto is better than [DBZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z)?

  

[![DBZ](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BBTUDb72xEQ/Xs576HGlIbI/AAAAAAAACSA/1suUNJaIWRkrH0kc0ZALtd-5dn9KjuhlQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600-rw/30153165832_f6bbf4e1c7_z.jpg "DBZ")](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BBTUDb72xEQ/Xs576HGlIbI/AAAAAAAACSA/1suUNJaIWRkrH0kc0ZALtd-5dn9KjuhlQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/30153165832_f6bbf4e1c7_z.jpg)

DBZ

  
  
  
The protagonists are similar in a way but are also highly different. Both protagonists, like in almost every shōnen, are stupid and goofy. But [Goku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goku), unlike Naruto, was extremely strong, to begin with. He never had any goals or dreams. He never got much character development, apart from the fact that he kept getting stronger.  
Naruto, on the other hand, shows great character development, from becoming a weak and a 'hyperactive knucklehead ninja' to an extremely strong ninja that everyone loved and respected. Naruto had a big dream, a dream to become the Hokage of his village and gain everyone's respect.  
  
Many people hate Fairy Tail for the excess Nakama power-ups. But they fail to realise that the Super Saiyan transformation is a Nakama power-up. The Super Saiyan form is achieved when a powerful Saiyan goes through intense emotions such as anger, hatred and desire.  
  
[Goku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goku) saw his best friend, Krillin die and became a Super Saiyan. Gohan saw Android 16 die and Ascended to the next level. But the fact of the matter is, there is no real explanation to these kinds of transformations because it literally is just a Nakama Power-up. The transformations in Naruto make a lot more sense.  
  
 For example -: The Sage Mode is achieved when a Ninja is able to blend Nature's energy with his own Chakra. It is basically tapping into the natural forces of the world. This transformation makes sense because not only is the science behind the transformation explained, the method of achieving this form is also shown.  
  
Yet another transformation which doesn't happen through Nakama power.  
 Naruto had to train very hard to tap into Nine-Tails' chakra. This transformation also carried a huge risk of being completely taken over by the Nine-Tails (towards the beginning). Again, this transformation made sense because the method of achieving the form was explained and we got to see Naruto being trained by the BADASS [KILLER BEE](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Killer_B)!  
  
Now, you could call this a personal opinion, but I feel the fights in Naruto were a lot more interesting than the ones in DBZ. As a kid, I'd obviously prefer hardcore fights with no real planning or strategy to them but just pure entertainment. But now that I've grown up, I'd obviously prefer a more strategic and well thought out battle. Most of the Naruto battles involve well thought out strategies and a lot of deception. Shikamaru taught us that brute force is not the key to winning.  
  
The better fight choreography, fights are actually tactical instead of reused 3-second punch/kick loopsMore complex and more diverse characters more diverse powers and much better thought out the power system way better fight animation naruto and Sasuke aren't hundreds of times more powerful than their peers deeper themes and more nuanced, complex writing more and better character developmentKickass soundtrack  
  

### Why naruto is better than [Boruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boruto:_Naruto_Next_Generations)?

  
I personally think that Naruto is way better than [Boruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boruto:_Naruto_Next_Generations), but we haven’t even come close to see what Boruto has to offer us. It is too soon to decide which one is better. But let’s try to decide on what we know till now. First, let's talk about the main characters.  
  
Naruto - a complete loser, good for nothing, abandoned and hated by others picked himself up on his own and never gave up on his dream of becoming Hokage. At the beginning of Naruto, he was the weakest of his class and when Naruto came to an end he became the strongest shinobi of all time.  
  
 Boruto is naturally talented, more like gifted. Just like Naruto said in 9th episode of Boruto “things tend to come too easily for Boruto”. He already knows the multi-shadow clone Jutsu, is quite intelligent, has a unique Dojutsu whose powers are yet to discovered. He is accepted by everyone and is the son of 7th Hokage. Both Naruto and Boruto care a lot about their friends and family and they will do anything to protect them.  
  
  

[![Boruto](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gL-DwPDaXM8/Xs576tuHXYI/AAAAAAAACR8/OyjId40ooYQWr5tULCWw08z00XYv5nrowCPcBGAYYCw/s1600-rw/Boruto_logo.png "Boruto")](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gL-DwPDaXM8/Xs576tuHXYI/AAAAAAAACR8/OyjId40ooYQWr5tULCWw08z00XYv5nrowCPcBGAYYCw/s1600-rw/Boruto_logo.png)

Boruto

  
  
  
Power, in naruto each individual has unique ability and skill and they also have shown how hard they worked to achieve it. But in Boruto there are no new abilities or exceptional skills. They got the same skills as of their parents. Even if there are new skills they don't awe you like they do in naruto.  
Character development, in Naruto each character has strong goals and desires to become Ninja and also the characters have powerful past, but in Boruto the characters are so simple, it is like watching a kid ninja serial.
