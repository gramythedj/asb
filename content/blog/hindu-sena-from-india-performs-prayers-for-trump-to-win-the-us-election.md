With few hours left for the US election results to come out and with Donald Trump’s fate hanging in the balance, his supporters in Delhi offered special prayers to ensure victory for Trump.

Workers and supporters of fringe outfit Hindu Sena carried out special prayers at a temple in Delhi on Tuesday. Prayers were conducted at a temple in East Delhi in the presence of a priest. A 30-minute special prayer with Hindu rituals was performed by the Hindu Sena in which they sought blessings for Donald Trump, who is seeking re-election in the US presidential elections.

Chanting of special mantras and a havan was seen at the special pooja ceremony in Delhi. The priest who performed the ceremony, Ved Shastri, told India Today TV that Donald Trump has been vocal against Islamic radicals and it is time for the world to support him in the US presidential elections.

  

The Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta told India Today TV, "Even for his last election we sought blessings for his victory. This time again we are seeking blessings for Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections. His winning will not only be a victory for the world but also for India as the US has been a good ally for us against China and Pakistan."
