No doubt that [Boruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boruto:_Naruto_Next_Generations) is actually just incredibly talented and strong, but I don't think he is as insane as everyone makes him out to be, at least when compared to the rest of the OP main cast.

Boruto

  

He has 3 nature transformations, large amounts of chakra, the Jogan which all that has been shown it could do is see chakra and invisible barriers between dimensions, Rasengan, wind-natured Rasengan, and Karma.

  

While that all may seem like a lot, the Jogan has so far been way overhyped, Karma is currently useless in a one-on-one battle, his wind-natured Rasengan is (currently) useless compared to his regular Rasengan, and while having 3 natures is cool and all it hasn't really added any significant power to him.

  

Now, this obviously means he has huge potential to grow, and he will most definitely get incredibly powerful in the near future once he has better control over Karma and learns stronger Jutsu.

  

Compare him to even someone in his own squad like Mitsuki. Mitsuki has similarly large amounts of chakra, has 2 nature transformations, has sensory capabilities, knows far more ninjutsu, jujutsu, and has access to the Sage mode (although he can only use it subconsciously).

boruto

  

Naruto when he was [Boruto's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boruto:_Naruto_Next_Generations) age, could summon Gamabunta, access a small but definitely meaningful amount of Kurama's chakra, was almost at the point where he knew Rasengan, had Multi-Shadow-Clone Jutsu, had actual feats in fights like beating Shukaku and holding back Manda/Aoda with his bare hands as well as taking down Haku.

  

While [Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) definitely didn't have as much raw talent as [Boruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boruto:_Naruto_Next_Generations) does when he was his age, Kid Naruto could have easily whooped Boruto's ass.

  

Sasuke, had the cursed seal, Chidori, 2 natures, taijutsu matching Rock Lee, a stronger Sharingan than Sadara, Katon (stronger than any Jutsu Boruto has aside from Rasengan), and just performed much better in fights than Boruto has.

  

Even ninjas from the previous generations like Kakashi, Itachi, the Sannin, not to mention the rest of the Hokage and Madara were all incredibly talented and had much more accomplishments when they were half the age of Boruto.

  

**My Points on it are as follows:**

  

I grew up watching Naruto, reading the manga during school, playing the games. It was one of the things I really loved.

  

It was the only series to make me tear up while watching it, how terrible of a childhood Naruto had, the death of Jiraiya, when [Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) met his parents through the imprints, etc. And while Naruto had a lot of deus ex machina, he really earned his power.

  

The immense training he went through, the trial and error, having to find a way to control Kurama, and so forth. The fans of the show followed him through it all.

  

That's why it irks me so much about [Boruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boruto:_Naruto_Next_Generations), his power so far isn't really earned but inherited, but already the series shows signs of him surpassing Naruto in the future. [Naruto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto) had Kurama, but even then that was more of a burden when he was young than a boon. By the time he could control it, he had already become a sage.

angry Naruto

  

Thus is more of a rant than anything, but if Boruto does really become stronger than naruto due to his inheritance and some training from Sasuke, It will leave me a terrible feeling in my stomach.

As of now, I really hate and love the series Boruto now.

  

I live it because it shows that Naruto had finally achieved his goal of bringing peace to the land, after all the pain and struggling he went threw, and it shows the rest of the cast having happy families.

  

But I honestly dislike how the show seems so adamant about pushing away the old characters we grew up with.

  

I understand the need for replacements and the need for new blood and stories, but I feel itâ€™s tearing down the legacy left behind by the old, and not emphasizing on their sacrifices and achievements more.

  

I kind of actually wish that they would have had Naruto die somehow before the new show, and had him passed down as a legend or something myself.
