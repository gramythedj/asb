### The Strongest Team

Angered by his failure to smash Erigor's wind armor, Natsu intensifies his fire and dissipates the heat of Erigor, defeating him. When Natsu's friends catch up with him, Kageyama takes Lullaby from Erigor and escapes to Clover on his enchanted car to carry out Eisenwald's plan. As he tries to destroy the guild masters outside the conference hall, Makarov is identified, who persuades him to surrender.  

However, the flute is discovered to hold a giant demon created by the ancient dark wizard Zeref, who escapes from the flute and seeks to destroy the guild masters independently. Natsu, Gray, and Erza vanquish the demon and free the guild masters, but in the end, they inadvertently obliterate the conference hall.
