**Monkey D. Luffy's Punch Is Revolutionary In 'One Piece'**

  

![Monkey D. Luffy is listed (or ranked) 1 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/81/1608893/original/1608893-photo-u66?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

It doesn't matter if it's technically a war crime, it doesn't matter if he's being shot at, and it doesn't matter who tries to stop him - Luffy is furious with the Celestial Dragons for hurting his friend, and he expresses that feeling with his fists.   

**All Might Defeats His Nemesis In 'My Hero Academia'   
**  

![All Might Defeats His Ne... is listed (or ranked) 2 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50108/1002154320/original/1002154320-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

All Might's final showdown against his nemesis All For One is one of the most epic moments in My Hero Academia so far. He puts all of his strength into his show-stopping move, United States of Smash, and successfully defeats him - a fitting end to an incredible career.  
  

Edward Elric Gives A Monster What He Deserves In ''Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood'  
  

![Edward Elric Gives A Mon... is listed (or ranked) 3 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50108/1002154343/original/1002154343-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Because of his horrific experimentation on his daughter and his dog, Shou Tucker is one of the most hated anime characters in history. That's why watching Edward Elric slam a fist right into his face is so cathartic - many fans wish it were their fists doing the job. 

**Leorio Paladiknight Stands Up For His Friend In 'Hunter x Hunter'  
**  

![Leorio is listed (or ranked) 4 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/72/1434716/original/1434716-photo-u5?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Despite not being one of the strongest characters in the series, Leorio is extremely loyal and is willing to throw down if you mess with his friends. That's why when he sees Ging, Gon's estranged father, he punches him straight in the face for the crime of abandoning his child.  

**Gon Freecss Loses Control In 'Hunter x Hunter'  
**  

![Gon Freecss is listed (or ranked) 5 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/3384/67662266/original/67662266-photo-u25?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

During his fight with Neferpitou, Gon is angrier and more out of control than he's ever been in his life. Though it's sad to see him reduced to such a state, it's also satisfying to see him let loose against one of the Chimera Ants responsible for his loss.   

**Edward Elric Destroys A God In 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood'   
**  

![Edward Elric is listed (or ranked) 6 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/46/915269/original/915269-photo-u40?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

After an all-out brawl that sees an entire city trying to take out a self-proclaimed deity, the most satisfying moment comes when Edward slams a fist into his previously untouchable face. Why is Ed able to do this? Because after absorbing Greed, Father's body has been transformed into brittle graphite.  

**Naruto Uzumaki Brings The Pain In 'Naruto'  
**  

![Naruto Uzumaki is listed (or ranked) 7 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/83/1647832/original/1647832-photo-u76?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Pain might have been ultimately defeated by Talk No Jutsu, but that doesn't mean there wasn't any muscle in it beforehand. Watching Naruto slam his opponents in the gut with a rasengan was one of the more awesome moments of the series.   

**Eren Jaeger Has What It Takes In 'Attack On Titan'   
**  

![Eren Jaeger is listed (or ranked) 8 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/4261/85210189/original/85210189-photo-u36?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Shortly after transforming into a Titan for the first time, Eren Jaeger shows off his raw strength by punching another Titan's head clean into a building. It's one of the first moments of hope in an extremely dark series.   

**Saitama's Punch Is Unbeatable In 'One-Punch Man'  
**  

![Saitama is listed (or ranked) 9 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/3844/76866172/original/76866172-photo-u42?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

As long as Saitama can land a hit, he can always defeat his enemy. As such, it's most satisfying when he's able to take down seemingly impossible opponents like the Deep Sea King.  

**Goku Knocks The Breath Out Of Frieza In 'Dragon Ball Z'  
**  

![Goku is listed (or ranked) 10 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/135/2685946/original/2685946-photo-u81?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

There's nothing like watching someone who absolutely deserves it a thousand times over get nailed in the stomach. During Goku's battle with the man who committed genocide against his people, Goku rams his fist straight into Frieza's gut, so hard that he gasps for air.  

**Leone Gives Honest What He Deserves In 'Akame Ga Kill!'  
**  

![Leone is listed (or ranked) 11 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/3840/76794461/original/76794461-photo-u6?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Honest is the Prime Minister of The Empire, and despite his name he's a lying, manipulative creep. In his showdown against Leone of the Night Raid, he gets punched in the face - but not before he opens fire into Leone's guts. Both lose their lives, Leone of her wounds and Honest after being tortured by a variety of rebels, making this hit as tragic as it is satisfying.  

**Meliodas & Ban Punch Each Other In 'The Seven Deadly Sins'  
**  

![Meliodas is listed (or ranked) 12 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/4269/85375180/original/85375180-photo-u13?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Despite caring deeply for Meliodas, Ban still has to defeat him in order to protect the person he loves the most - and while Meliodas also cares about Ban, he has his own reasons for refusing to back down. The two go toe to toe in the Perfect Cube, which is made to protect bystanders. The final fistfight that ends in a draw, but it's still satisfying because it proves that their friendship is intact at the end.  
  

**Kamina Snaps Simon Out Of It In 'Tengan Toppa Gurren Lagann'  
**  

![Kamina is listed (or ranked) 13 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/3831/76616495/original/76616495-photo-u22?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Sometimes, the most satisfying punches are done out of love. When Simon freaks out and loses the ability to concentrate on a mission, Kamina hurries over to him and launches a fist into his face. After snapping him out of his meltdown, he gives him a reassuring pep talk.   

**Light Yagami Lets His Frustration Out In 'Death Note'  
**  

![Light Yagami is listed (or ranked) 14 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/535/10697446/original/10697446-photo-u101?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

The tension between Light and L is one of the driving forces of the series, so when the tension finally bubbles over and they actually come to blows, it's a relief. The actual fight is triggered when L expresses his lack of motivation to continue the Kira case, and Light, who has forgotten that he _IS _Kira, is furious that he'd even consider giving up when lives are at stake.   
  

Jotaro Kujo Gets Revenge On Steely Dan In 'JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'  
  

![Jotaro Kujo is listed (or ranked) 15 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/67/1327199/original/1327199-photo-u16?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

After Steely Dan has Jotaro in what basically amounts to servitude, Jotaro is furious. When he finally gets the chance to unleash a flurry of his signature ORA OR ORA ORA attacks with the help of Star Platinum, it's cathartic for the audience and exquisitely painful for Steely Dan.   
  

Simon Gives Izaya What's Coming To Him In 'Durarara!'  
  

![Simon Gives Izaya What's Comin is listed (or ranked) 16 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50108/1002154351/original/1002154351-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

Izaya Orihara is a lot of Durarara! fans' favorite character, but that doesn't mean he doesn't deserve to get decked. When Simon knocks him into a wall and then lectures him about casually destroying peoples' lives, it's impossible not to cheer him on.   

**Mamoru Takamura Takes Down Bryan Hawk In 'Hajime To Ippo'  
**  

![Mamoru Takamura is listed (or ranked) 17 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/76/1507591/original/1507591-photo-u5?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

After watching Mamoru Takamura work his butt off to conquer the world of boxing, of course viewers want to see him succeed against his opponents - especially those like Bryan Hawk who get by on "natural talent" and don't really train. The decisive punch that ends their match and Hawk's career is kind of hard not to get emotional about.   
  

Touma Kamijou Overcomes Accelerator's Powers In 'A Certain Magical Index'  
  

![Touma Kamijou Overcomes Accele is listed (or ranked) 18 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50108/1002154340/original/1002154340-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

What happens when somebody that can negate other people's abilities goes up against somebody who can reverse the vectors of anything that tries to touch him? It turns out that the first ability prevails, which is why Touma Kamijou is just about the only person capable of launching an effective attack against Accelerator.  
  

Seishuu Handa Won't Stand For Criticism In 'Barakamon'  
  

![Seishuu Handa Won't Stand For  is listed (or ranked) 19 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50108/1002154321/original/1002154321-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

If you've ever felt like punching some smug jerk who insulted your hard work, watching Seishuu Handa do just that to a calligraphy appraiser dissing his art probably felt pretty satisfying. Satisfying or not, though, it wasn't a good idea - which is why his dad sends him to a remote island to calm down.  
  

Suruga Kanbaru Sends A Vampire Flying In 'Bakemonogatari'   
  

![Suruga Kanbaru Sends A Vampire is listed (or ranked) 20 on the list The 20 Most Satisfying Anime Punches of All Time](https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50108/1002154402/original/1002154402-photo-u1?w=650&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces)

  

It's not that Suruga Kanbaru's reasons for punching Koyomi Araragi into oblivion are satisfying - her desire to eliminate him because of his relationship with her crush is actually pretty creepy. But with her brute strength and the creepy atmosphere of the show itself, it's hard not to be moved by the punch as a piece of cinema.
