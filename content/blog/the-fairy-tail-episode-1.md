Lucy Heartfilia, the 17-year-old Celestial Wizard, wishing to join a Fairy Tail wizard guild, is almost hypnotized into an admirer by a flirtatious wizard named Salamander. She is rescued by mistaking Igneel's "salamander," a fire-lizard, whom they are hunting for when Natsu Dragneel and his cat-like companion, Happy, approach him. Although Lucy buys the two travelers a meal as thanks, they feel indebted and promise to repay her properly. Later, Salamander tells Lucy that he is a member of Fairy Tail and invites her to a yacht party in exchange for membership, intending to smuggle her and other young girls he has kidnapped. Natsu and Happy rescue Lucy again, And Salamander is revealed as an impostor named Bora. In his dragon slayer spells, Natsu kills Bora, discovering that he is the true Salamander, and in the process, killing it unwittingly. He then invites Lucy to join Fairy Tail, which she welcomes happily as they leave the army.
