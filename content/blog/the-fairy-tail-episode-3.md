Infiltrate the Everlue Mansion

Although she settles in, Lucy, Natsu, and Happy seem uninvited in her new flat. Lucy reveals her magic by calling a divine mind that she calls Plue, which suggests that Natsu and Happy make a Lucy squad. Natsu gets her to take a job from Duke Everlue, her repulsive owner, to steal a book entitled Daybreak that demands her employment as a maiden. They come and Shirotsume to figure out that Kaby Melon, their customer, has changed their job to ruin the book and boosted the award to 2 million jewels. When Everlue declines to reveal Lucy, the three penetrate his mansion and snatch the journal. Everyone and his sisters, however, assault the three. Before Everlue captures her, Natsu beats the Bodyguards of Everlue and the Vanish Brothers. He fled to his sewers and discovered the secrets of the book.
