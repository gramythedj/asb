Wizard King

#### Lumiere Silvamillion Clover  

Lumiere Silvamillion Clover was a human prince from the first days of the Clover Kingdom who wanted to make life better for everyone in making Magic Tools and befriends Licht as both desired co-existence between their peoples. On the day of his sister's secret marriage to Licht, Lumiere was subdued by the Zagred-possessed prime minister after sending the manipulated royals to slaughter the elves and force Licht into becoming a Dark Elf to serve as a temporary vessel.

Lumiere arrives in time as Licht begs Lumiere to kill him, after cursing his body so Zagred cannot use it. Lumiere is named the 1st Wizard King soon after. Severely injured after his battle with the monstrous Licht, Lumiere has Secre petrify him, so he can be revived by her should Zagred resurface.

Once Zagred is defeated and the elf souls allowed to rest in peace, Lumiere joins them in the afterlife as the magic that kept him alive wears off, and is content that his ideal live on in the new generation.

Julius Novachrono is the 28th Wizard King and user of Time Magic, his obsession with new and strange forms of magic having him shirk from his duties on his free time.

  

Julius was previously the Magic Knight-Captain of the Aqua Deer Squad when they were previously the Grey Deer Squad; Yami and Vangeance both being members whom Julius personally recruited into the Magic Knights. Although he is killed by Patry to acquire the Magic Stones that he had Yami and the Black Bulls secure, he eventually revived himself through an ancient magic tool that he previously-stored 13 years' worth of time in.

  

This process revived Julius as a 13-year-old boy with his powers reduced, rendering him unable to carry out part of his duties as Wizard King. Despite this, he continues to work to support the Magic Knights, while keeping his age a secret from the public.

### House Kira

One of the three royal houses alongside Houses Vermilion and Silva, House Kira lineage dates back to the foundation of the Clover Kingdom and genocide of the Elves.

Augustus Kira Clover XIII the current King Clover and member of House Kira is an arrogant and petty person who thinks that being noble is everything and has nothing but contempt for commoners. He is extremely envious that the people fail to acknowledge him when compared to the Wizard King. 

  

  

Augustus's need to be recognized motivated his decision to take credit for the Royal Knights which Julius actually devised. While extremely powerful as a member of royalty through his use of light magic, Augustus's overconfidence that his position alone made him superior to potential opponents convinced him to not hone his skills. Thus a majority of his spells are mostly showy displays of power meant to impress others, though they usually have the opposite effect and are easily dispatched.

#### Damnatio Kira

Damnatio Kira is a member of House Kira who is chairman of the Clover Kingdom's Magic Parliament, a manipulative and ruthless man who places justice above even his own family. He is also a user of Scale Magic, making him able to shrink and counter all forms of magic save Anti-Magic.

  

Following the elf incident, after dispatching anti-monarchist nobles who attempted to kill Augustus in the confusion, Damnatio oversees Asta's trial for using forbidden magic before the Black Bulls intervene with Julius passing a decree for a Black Bull mission outside the Clover Kingdom to hinder Damantio's inquisition. Damnatio allows this, but vows to place every Magic Knight through an inquisition should Asta's mission fails and threatens the Clover Kingdom in any way.

### Owen

Owen is a Magic Knight and Julius's right hand who is the best healer in the Clover Kingdom, possessing Water Healing magic that allows him to reattach severed arms or emulate X-rays.

After the fight in the Underwater Sea Temple, he tells Asta that he won't be able to use his arms, infected by the Ancient Curse magic, as his bones are turning to dust. After Patry completes the reincarnation ritual, Owen ends up being possessed by an Elf spirit with his magic inverted to destroy rather than heal.
