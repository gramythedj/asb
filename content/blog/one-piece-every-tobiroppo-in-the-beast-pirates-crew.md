The Tobiroppo are six pirates in the Beasts Pirates crew who rank directly below the level of the All-Stars. All members of the Tobiroppo are known to have been former pirate captains who joined Kaido due to his mighty power.

In terms of strength, the Tobiroppo seem to be quite strong as they're even competing with the All-Stars of the Beasts Pirates. However, among their ranks, different characters possess a different level of strength. Here are all the members of the Tobiroppo ranked according to how strong they are.

Black Maria

Black Maria is a member of the Tobiroppo and is one of the few characters whose powers still remain a mystery as of now. She is extremely tall and towers over most of the cast, which gives her a certain edge in battle. Her Devil Fruit ability remains unknown, but she's certainly an Ancient Zoan user, as suggested by Hyougoro during the Onigashima Raid. Being an elite fighter of the Beasts Pirates, it goes without saying that she's going to be a capable Haki user. Unfortunately, very little is known about her abilities, which is why she finds her way at the bottom of this list as of now.

Page One

Page One is the youngest known member of the Tobiroppo and he was first introduced in the Wano Country arc's second act where he took on Sangoro of the Soba stall in battle. Being a member of the Tobiroppo, it goes without saying that he has the powers of dinosaur Zoan as well. Page One has eaten an Ancient Zoan Spinosaurus Devil Fruit that allows him to transform into said creature and access its hybrid form at will. Thanks to this power, he has tremendous strength up his sleeve, and more importantly, he's incredibly difficult to damage in battle. If that wasn't enough, Page One is also a user of Haki, as confirmed during his clash against Luffy in Onigashima. Although he appears to be one of the weakest in the group, he's still extremely powerful.

Ulti

Page One's elder sister, Ulti is also a former pirate captain who joined the Beasts Pirates at an unknown time in the last 20 years of the One Piece world. She is a rash person with quite a temper, which she often uses as a driving factor during her battles. Ulti is incredibly powerful, as evident from the fact that her Zoan transformation was dangerous enough for Luffy to consider going Gear Fourth.

She has eaten an Ancient Zoan Pachycephalosaurus Devil Fruit which lets her turn into the creature at will. Her Haki was great enough to match Luffy's even after the latter trained it a lot in Udon, once again, showing that she's no pushover at all. Ulti also possesses great durability as she tanked Yamato's Thunder Bagua without much trouble.

Sasaki

Sasaki appears to be among the stronger members of the Tobiroppo. First introduced in the Third Act of Wano Country, he, just like every other member of the group, was tasked with finding Yamato. Although he was captured by Denjiro, Sasaki managed to break free and is currently preparing to fight the Straw Hat Pirates.

Like Black Maria, his Devil Fruit power remains unknown, but it is highly likely that he has a dinosaur power up his sleeve as well. The biggest indication of his power level comes from his rivalry with Who's Who, as both of them are actively aiming for a spot among the All-Stars far more than any other members of the group.

X Drake

A former member of the Tobiroppo, X Drake is also a member of the Worst Generation & joined Kaido's crew shortly before the two-year time-skip in the story. During that time, he worked his way up from a regular Headliner to a Flying Six. Drake is a user of the Ancient Zoan Allosaurus Devil Fruit and it allows him to turn into the creature and its hybrid whenever he wishes to do so. He's got great durability and physical strength. He's fought strong characters like Sanji in Wano and his X-Calibur technique was equal to Luffy's Kong Gun as both knocked out an artificially created Ancient Giant in a single blow. Without a doubt, X Drake is an incredibly powerful character to take on in battle.

Who's Who

Depicted as one of the strongest members, Who's Who is a man who wants to rise further in rank and become a member of the All-Stars, more than most Tobiroppo members. He also seems to hold a grudge against Queen, although why exactly remains to be seen.

Who's Who's abilities aren't known at the moment, but it is implied that he either has a dinosaur Devil Fruit power, or one related to an ancient cat, as that's a theme central to his crew. Who's Who is likely a user of Haki as well, as is expected from someone of his caliber. In the future, more of his abilities will be revealed to the fans.
