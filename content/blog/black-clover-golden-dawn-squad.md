 The Golden Dawn are the strongest order of Magic Knights, at least according to Wizard King Julius' "Star" System of rankings. The selection of most of its members is later revealed to have been part of Patry's plan as most of them are reincarnated elves.

William Vangeance is the Golden Dawn leader and a potential heir to Julius as Wizard King, possessing vast mana and can use World Tree Magic. Born as an illegitimate child to an unknown noble, Vangeance suffered a horrific abusive childhood before being accepted as an aristocrat. He formed a deep friendship with Patry, who reincarnated into his body, as William's desire to care for the soul inside him gave him a reason to live through his childhood. Julius served as a mentor and friend to William, even making the mask that William wears, which he made special for him to conceal the scar he was born with. As Yami had suspicions of them prior due to William and Patry's similarities, William is ultimately suppressed when Patry takes complete control of his host's body through the completed reincarnation ritual. William eventually regains his body when Asta exorcizes Patry at the elf's request so his magic can help Licht calm the other reincarnated elves and allow them to move on the afterlife, allowing him to resume his duties as a Magic Knight after Julius forgives him for his role in Patry's actions. Zenon Zogratis later abduct William for the Dark Triad's aim of creating a Tree of Qliphoth.  

#### Langris Vaude

Langris Vaude is the Golden Dawn's former vice-captain and Finral's younger brother, having replaced him as their family's heir due to possessing stronger and more offensive Spatial Magic compared to Finral. This made Langris develop an arrogant attitude towards his brother. However, Langris secretly envies his brother's good-natured personality, noticing people prefer Finral's company to his. Langris feels he must be better than Finral in every aspect, or else he is worthless. Langris ends up being possessed by the spirit of Patry's cousin Latry after Patry completes the ritual to resurrect the elves. Latry storming the palace to take Augustus Kira Clover XIII hostage while subjecting him to torture before Yami, Finral, and Jack arrive to stop the elf. Langris partially reconciles with Finral, gaining an understanding with him, but insists Finral breaks his womanizing habits if he truly wants to be head of House Vaude, not wanting him to get his happy ending so easily.

Mimosa Vermillion is a royal of Vermillion Family and a member of the Golden Dawn, being Noelle Silva's cousin through the latter's aunt marrying into Vermillion House, who uses Plant Magic, specializing in healing spells. Her healing magic proves useful during the battle against the reincarnated elves. After seeing a child steal bread to feed herself and a younger one, Mimosa learned not to share the superficial and arrogant outlooks of other nobles and royal, and appreciate people according to their worth, specifically having a deep respect for Noelle due to her working harder than any other noble. This leads to her kinder and gentler personality, though she can be blunt and rude to people she hates. She also falls deeply in love with Asta, after seeing him fight against all odds despite having no magic.  

#### Alecdora Sandler

Alecdora Sandler is a nobleman and member of the Golden Dawn who uses Sand Magic. He is mostly stoic in nature, having completely devoted himself to William since being saved during a mission and believing that only he can fulfil his captain's dream of becoming Wizard King. This placed him at odds with Yuno whom he considered unworthy of William's favour and utterly loathed him for wanting to become the next Wizard King. This eventually came to a head during the Royal Knights Selection Exam when Sandler and Yuno battled on opposing teams, with Sandler losing in a one-on-one battle with Yuno.
