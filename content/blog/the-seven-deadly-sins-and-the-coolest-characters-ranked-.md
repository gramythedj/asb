The seven deadly sins and the coolest characters ranked!

The anime takes on a peculiar twist that initially paints the show's protagonists as a notorious group of powerful knights who once wreaked havoc on Britannia's kingdoms, the series' fictional main setting, Each Sins member brings unique power sets and characters that sometimes clash, but some members are certainly cooler than others. Here are the theories why.

coolest character : Escanor

Basically, Escanor is the equivalent of a Superman-Incredible Hulk hybrid of the Seven Deadly Sins. The more he's exposed to sunshine, much like the Man of Steel, he gets stronger. but in reverse, he also transforms into a frail, unassuming man at night. Similarly, as he becomes more dominant, Escanor 's personality shifts.

Escanor is able to exceed even Meliodas in his best form at the height of his strength. In addition, he is the only one of the Sins to be seen to be able to fight two members of The Ten Commandments easily.

his famous weapon: Divine Axe Rhitta (similar to thor hammer)

  

Coolest no 2: Meliodas

  

  

the leader of the Seven Deadly Sins, Meliodas is probably one of the team's strongest guy(Probably deadly sins anime). He is a member of the demon race, but he wants nothing more than to bring an end to the reign of terror of his kin over Britannia. This alone makes him one of the coolest characters in the entire series, if not the coolest. In addition, one of the anime's strongest and coolest-looking powers is his Full Counter strength.

The desire of Meliodas to do perverted things to Elizabeth and other female characters he's attracted to, however, is one of the few troublesome characteristics he shows. And unlike Ban, despite owning the Boar Hat tavern, he is an awful cook.

Symbol of love and thief: Ban  

Ban is easily the Seven Deadly Sins' coolest-looking member (as if the spiky hair wasn't a dead giveaway). He not only looks at the part, but the forces of Ban are probably also the coolest among the Sins.

Ban also fights for fun with Meliodas, which makes him one of the few who can endure such a feat, and one of the funniest relationships in general in the whole series is their rivalry. Though often greedy and adamant about a fault, with his devotion to his fellow Sins and other allies, Ban continually redeems himself. Plus, he's a terrific chef.

Spoiler alert: after training for more than 60000(probable) years in purgatory, he can become next most powerful than Meliodas itself.....

  

Neutral dude: Gowther

considers human emotions a mystery as the most eccentric and vague member of the Sins, and is often unsure of how to reciprocate or react in certain social circumstances. This has often made him behave heinously against others, such as playing with Guila whom he brainwashed into loving him in order to grasp the meaning of love better.

For a variety of reasons, it's hard not to like Gowther (his unnecessary "cute" poses are amusing for starters), but at the same time, he's a character who can be frustrating to watch and challenging to cheer for. Which sometimes makes him toe the line between acting lame and being cool.

Sexy and clever: Merlin

Merlin is over 3,000 years old and people are unable to say her true name. In all of Britannia, she is the most powerful wizard and she has no qualms about dressing provocatively in public, which speaks to her faith. However, aside from that, Merlin is simply a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. This can seem cool on the surface, but it is quite played-out and can become rather boring.

There really are no character defects or glaring shortcomings in Merlin, which makes her overall unrelatable and cold. On the other hand, as she's usually the most level-headed member, Merlin does fill her role among the Sins very well.

Lazy and shy: King

Fairy King Harlequin has a lot to like, most of which are based on his powers and weapons. As for the character himself, as far as his attitude goes, he leaves a lot to be wished for.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/QTMMKZIN7PXGTF1VHcx-62te65c02jjArptTTX_xf2ippMUsGVklpo8MW5C5o6k3MTU3iEMDAdJ49P9D3hReFFQtCmzGnOB1_wF-f1D02_ohOr0j2QM5X3kF8nv9Ojt0je9GuHH5)

While King is linked to his timid nature and lack of trust, which may resonate with many viewers, he is less cool than he should be because of his laziness, emotional instability, and inability to take initiative. This is a shame, for the King is the most humane and morally upright among the Sins. Moreover, his love for Diane, which is a pretty lame and shallow reason to be heroic, is the only thing that truly motivates King.

Excited and powerful: Diane

face value, there is nothing very interesting about the character of Diane as she has remained largely one-dimensional throughout her storey arc. Although season 4 focuses on fixing this during the first half of the season, so far, the past of her character from previous seasons does not really paint Diane as an engaging member of the Sins.

Early on, for no obvious reason, Diane is infatuated with Meliodas, and her ignorance of the King's love for her made her off-put to some fans. Sometimes, along with Elizabeth, Diane is relegated to a fan-service role, which is great, but it then takes away from her other cooler qualities.
