## Buyer’s Guide to Dental Intraoral Camera

### Features to take care of Dental Intraoral Camera

-   #### Image Quality  
    Start by deciding what purposes you need to utilise an intraoral camera like the IRIS HD Camera for. For example, in order to increase case acceptance rates, one dental practice may use the camera to present cases to patients while another practice will only be interested in the images for purposes of documentation only. Another dentist might use intraoral cameras to took external images too.

However, you should need to hang a few in your hand and compare how comfortable you would be when using each of those cameras.

These may be easy to use in case you are turning the camera around into the mouth of the patient in order to capture various images from various angles.
