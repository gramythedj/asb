**Joint Facilities Advisory Committee Update**

The month of March was busy for the Joint Facilities Advisory Committee (JFAC) and its related subcommittees. Through the next year, until voting day 2022 and beyond, JFAC will provide monthly updates to the Amherst School Board, at board meetings and in board communications to the public, such as in these letters and on social media.

**Public Relations Committee**

The PR committee is creating an in-depth calendar to outline the plan and the resources needed to promote this project to the Amherst community. There are several mediums the committee will use to seek more information from voters - website, videos, social media, mailings, Nixle updates, and more.

The beginning of April kicked off the campaign with two initiatives - a postcard sent to every household in Amherst and a video to introduce voters to JFAC. Keep an eye on your mailbox for the postcard and be sure to check out the video and website ([JFAC.SAU39.org](https://jfac.sau39.org/)) for more information.

**Clark School Exploration Committee**

The Clark School Exploration subcommittee has been tasked with gathering input from community experts and stakeholders on possible ways to utilize the Clark School building and site should the new elementary school bond pass next year.

The committee has met virtually with various stakeholders groups including town representatives, neighbors of the Clark property, and many residents to gather input and will continue this mission in the coming months. A presentation of findings is planned for the May JFAC meeting to be followed up with the June Amherst School Board meeting.

If you have additional feedback about the future of the Clark property, please join us for the public comments session at our next board meeting.

**Facilities Project Team**

This group has been active for months, reviewing conceptual designs, analyzing costs, and continuing to line up the next steps of the project. The first of these important steps is underway as a request for proposals (RFP) has been sent to architects across New Hampshire and northern Massachusetts. The RFP is designed to find an architect who will
take our conceptual drawings and lead us into the next phase of the project. You can find details of the RFP on the [SAU 39 website](https://www.sau39.org/Page/577).

The JFAC committee will meet again Thursday, April 15th at 6 p.m.
For further updates, visit [JFAC.SAU39.org](https://jfac.sau39.org/) and [Facebook.com/JointFacilities](https://facebook.com/JointFacilities).

**Start time and School Calendar Changes:** All district boards have voted to change the school start times in the fall. The new school schedule is:

* Clark-Wilkins- 7:45 a.m.- 2:15 p.m.
* AMS- 8:30 a.m. - 3:15 p.m.

The first day of school is now August 31st with students attending three days of school before Labor Day weekend. After guidance from the state, February vacation is now scheduled for February 28th-March 4th. The SAU is working to identify community needs for before and after school care options. A survey will be available soon to gauge the needs of our families.

**Budget:** A reminder that our deliberative session will now be held on May 4th. Further details on location and Covid protocols are forthcoming. The later voting day and deliberative will allow us to review our budget items one last time at our April 5th meeting, using actual health insurance costs and more concrete enrollment numbers, rather than estimates. If you were not able to attend the live meeting, you can watch our discussion on the [SAU YouTube Page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI5AKcilHlhUtEJlGZENgMg).

**Policy Review:** We are beginning our annual review of policies. The policies that will be under review this summer are open for public comment until June 1st. The list of policies to be reviewed can be found on the Policy Committee section of the SAU website. Feel free to send comments regarding any policies up for review to the current policy chairperson
ekuzsma@sau39.org.

Remember that you can always reach out to the board regarding any concerns either at public comment or by emailing asb@sau39.org. All emails to the board are considered public record and added to our board minutes.

* April 5- Amherst School Board Meeting 6 p.m.
