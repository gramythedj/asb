### Dear Kaby

Lucy discovers that Everlue has blackmailed the late author of Daybreak, Kemu Zaleon, to write a book for him while in solitary confinement for three years. Lucy summons her crab spirit Cancer against Everlue, causing the duke to summon Virgo, his monstrous maid spirit; to the horror of all, Natsu emerges next to Virgo after capturing her upstairs. After Natsu and Lucy defeat Everlue and Virgo, Daybreak returns to Kaby, Kemu's son, who aims to protect his father's honor by burning a book. But Lucy discovers that the novel is secretly Kemu's memoir written for Kaby, persuading him to keep the book. To Lucy's dismay, Natsu cuts the 2 million jewelry award by discovering that Kaby doesn't have the money to send them. On their way home, the three of them fend off a team of dark wizards alongside their guildmate, Gray Fullbuster. One of the evil wizards utters "Lullaby" until a magical shadow engulfs them.
