### Natsu vs. Erza

Returning to Magnolia, Natsu duels Erza as a test of strength. However, the Magic Council's emissary stops the duel and arrests Erza for the harm incurred during the Fairy Tail fight with Eisenwald. Siegrain, a council member, warns that Erza should keep a secret of their common history. Macau disguises himself as Natsu in hopes of saving his life, allowing Natsu to storm the headquarters of the council and save Erza. However, he learns that Erza is simply a mock trial for the council to assert its jurisdiction and that the two are expected to spend the night in a cage.  

Natsu attempts to resume his match at the guild the next day but easily beats him with a single blow. Still determined to prove himself, Natsu asks Happy for an S-Class job against Makarov's permission; Lucy joins them after finding that the award contains the zodiac key that she needs to obtain.
