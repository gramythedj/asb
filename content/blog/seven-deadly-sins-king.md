Introduction
------------

King is the Grizzly's Sin of Sloth of the Seven Deadly Sins. His real name is Fairy King Harlequin and he is the protector of the Fairy King's Forest and the Fairy Realm. His Sacred Treasure is the Spirit Spear Chastiefol, which he uses in conjunction with his inherent power, Disaster. He is also the older brother of Elaine, the guardian of the Fountain of Youth, as well as the husband of Diane, a fellow member of the Sins, and a future Giant Queen.

King's fairy form resembles a young boy with short brown hair, a high forehead, thin eyebrows, and brownish-orange eyes. He wears a long orange and an aqua sweatshirt with a hood and navy blue sleeves, quarter-length navy blue pants, and short boots with large buttons matching his hoodie. He also carries a green leopard pattern pillow which is actually a transformation of his spear Chastiefol. Despite being a fairy, he has yet to grow visible wings.

He wears an enlarged version of the clothes he wears as a fairy, though he can freely change the clothes he wears in this form.

Ten years ago, he wore full-body light green armour with a helmet that fits the size of his human form. King's wanted poster depicts him as a big man with short hair, sideburns, a button nose, and a sneer. His Seven Deadly Sins Grizzly symbol is located just above his left ankle, on the outer side of his lower leg.

After the Kingdom Infiltration arc, King attached Helbram's helmet to the hood of his jacket.

After completing Gloxinia's trial in the past, King grew tiny wings on his back resembling those of a butterfly's.

During the battle against Mael, King's wings develop completely in the form of huge butterfly wings, coming together with a new form in which King's body becomes that of a taller and thinner teenager, with a longer hairstyle with a populated frontal crest. When wearing clothes, he wears a suit. It has also been shown that King is still able to transform into his human form, with this form's appearance being almost exactly the same as before, with the exception of this form now possessing the same hairstyle and wings as his current appearance. Also, like before, he wears an enlarged version of the suit he wears as a fairy. It has also been revealed that in the event that King completely exhausts himself, his appearance reverts back to that of his original appearance.

Meliodas once referred him as the Sins' "pet" when describing King to Elizabeth; and indeed, King's slowness to resort to unnecessary harm may well make him as their most morally-upright member. He appeared to be somewhat lazy, preferring to levitate in most occasions. In the past, he was shown to be a compassionate character who returned stuffed animals stolen by Ban to children. Furthermore, it appears that he is an emotional person who cries easily. King has trouble admitting his affection for Diane. Although he enjoys being with Meliodas and Diane, he could not bring himself to express it. He cares deeply for his sister, Elaine, as shown when he was willing to take revenge for her death by "killing" Ban.

King is also shown to have a caring side. He helps the Seven Deadly Sins in their battle against the Holy Knights, although he claims it is merely for Diane. Despite being the Sin of Sloth, he is hardworking and serious at times. When King joins the group, he starts to act like the only rational one in the group, and questions his teammates' erratic and slightly insane actions, such as their nonchalance about losing their sacred treasures. When forced to do something he dislikes, King can easily be motivated if it will make Diane happy. Despite King's kind personality, he is not against killing someone, if pushed to his limits. King was willing to kill Guila and Jericho if they continued to attack him but was unable to after Helbram saved the two.
