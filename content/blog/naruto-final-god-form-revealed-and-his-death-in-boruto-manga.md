Naruto final god form Revealed and his Death in Boruto Manga

Boruto Chapter 52 Manga
-----------------------

we have been waiting to see Naruto Beat the Isshiki in the Boruto Manga and finally, it happened, but at a very different cost, Naruto Decided to sacrifice himself in return of using the God Kurama, though the name is not revealed its definitely an above god which gives tremendous energy and power for a very short amount of time (for 10 to 15 mins), upon using the god form your life span will decrease very fast that our naruto will survive another 30 mins in the Boruto manga and also his chakra is draining too fast fighting Isshiki.

### The positives

the positive of using this god power is the opponent's power and life span will drain fast and Isshiki said that he will survive another 30 mins and will be dead before Naruto dies.

### god level speed

Naruto is able to stop the Isshiis rods attack in a flash, even Sasuke said that that he cannot even track the rods with his Sharingan but Naruto is able to dodge them very Easily this shows that Naruto is way faster and Reaction time is god level and in the taijutsu, he beat the Ishhiki crap out of him and even made him bleed continuously.

### Final update

but one thing is sure Naruto is going to die in the next chapter as his chakra is completely draining and even Kurama said that whoever uses this technique has to sacrifice at the end and this power is very similar to Eight Gates but here in this case opponents life span decreases wherever naruto touches him, next chaplet will be releasing on Dec 20, all fingers crossed as both are on the verge of death, naruto and IsshikiÂ  and we don't know what happens, and Sasuke is out of chakra and even after the final blow from Naruto, Isshiki said his life span is no more than 3 minutes
