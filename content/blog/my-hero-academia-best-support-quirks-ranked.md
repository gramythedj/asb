The superhero anime My Hero Academia imagines a world where 80% of people have superpowers or mutations known as quirks. Some quirks allow a person to launch fire or ice, or some result in helpful bodily mutations or heightened senses. The variety of quirks we've seen so far is dazzling.

  

But not all quirks are like Izuku's quirk, One For All. Some heroes are front line fighters who like to get up close and dirty to beat down villains, while other heroes are better off providing support from a distance. Some quirks are, in fact, better for search and rescue jobs than for fighting.

  

**10\. Navel Laser**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K3-XGwtb1wM/XzKjNG69J0I/AAAAAAAAAQ0/zgUMrs6ZMBMGLKUPPETiABLgk_P1eFO1QCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/10.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K3-XGwtb1wM/XzKjNG69J0I/AAAAAAAAAQ0/zgUMrs6ZMBMGLKUPPETiABLgk_P1eFO1QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/10.jpg)

  

Student #1 of hero class 1-A is the pompous blondie Yuga Aoyama. But don't count on him in a duel, since his navel laser doesn't do much good in a fistfight. His dodging skills and constitution aren't very impressive, either. But he's not useless! Yuga is a sort of sniper, and if he can keep a friendly hero between him and the villain, his laser can provide some great long-range firepower. The beam is hard-hitting and precise, and Yuga's stylish hero costume helps him fire it more accurately for a long period of time. Ready, aim, fire!

**9\. Electricity**

Denki Kaminari may have the worst grades in hero class 1-A, and he often serves as comic relief, but that doesn't make him a lousy fighter. In a one on one fight, it's easy to subdue him if his electricity can't knock out his opponent right away. Instead, he can keep a distance and zap any opponent into submission. If his allies can set up some conductive materials such as water or metal, even better!

  

**8\. Earphone Jack**

Like some heroes and students on this list, Kyoka Jiro has a rather modest constitution, and this petite girl won't last long in a scrap. Her earphone jacks are very flexible support quirks, though. With them, she can easily listen for just about anything, which makes this quirk excellent for scouting and search and rescue ops. In a pinch, Jiro has been known to implant her jacks into the ground and create shock waves with sheer sonic power.

  

**7\. Anivoice**

Koji Koda is a big guy, but it's Rikido Sato who should do the fist-fighting around here. This soft-spoken boy can speak to animals of all kinds, and that makes him a sort of summoner in battle. So long as birds, insects, squirrels, or any other wildlife is around, Koji can command them. Birds can scout, insects can annoy or scare off people (like Present Mic), and some species are capable of injuring a person. In a park or forest, Koji is never alone!

  

**6\. Pop off**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zW8MFeoxFCg/XzKjrAnh-uI/AAAAAAAAARY/z5367FDavrEIPN6VEv-j4pUSmip4Oi8gACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/06.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zW8MFeoxFCg/XzKjrAnh-uI/AAAAAAAAARY/z5367FDavrEIPN6VEv-j4pUSmip4Oi8gACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/06.jpg)

  

True, Mineta spends most of his screen time as obnoxious comic relief, and he has an unfortunate cowardly streak. But when Mineta finds his courage, his battle skills are not to be underestimated. He's no front-line hero, but his sticky blobs can quickly trap a villain and stick them to a wall, the floor, or even another person. With these, Mineta can easily trap a target and allow another hero to deliver the final blow.

  

**5\. Zero Gravity**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q0R75kl_szo/XzKj1FQes-I/AAAAAAAAARk/35PZR1N58JA5jt3MISpWCnBOsVsYSVapgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/05.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Q0R75kl_szo/XzKj1FQes-I/AAAAAAAAARk/35PZR1N58JA5jt3MISpWCnBOsVsYSVapgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/05.jpg)

  

Ochaco works best in search and rescue operations since her quirk can make even the heaviest obstacles or rubble a  breeze to remove. With a touch, she can make something (or someone) totally weightless, and even massive boulders can be lifted, no problem. As we see in the provisional license arc, Zero Gravity is ideal for removing rubble from fallen buildings, allowing heroes to reach and retrieve victims trapped inside.

  

**4\. Tape**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0vUQVr56dqk/XzKj8PNmcpI/AAAAAAAAARs/8EST1IdfaiYmIfPk3wWV26j9WqGWQotcQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/04.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0vUQVr56dqk/XzKj8PNmcpI/AAAAAAAAARs/8EST1IdfaiYmIfPk3wWV26j9WqGWQotcQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/04.jpg)

  

Hanta Sero's quirk is pretty straightforward, but no less effective for it! This boy can launch tape from his elbows, and that tape is tough and very sticky, as one might expect. Along with Ochaco's quirk, this ability is perfectly tailored for rescue operations, where that tape can prevent items from falling apart or moving around. He can also incapacitate a foe and allow a front-line fighter to land the final blow.

  

**3\. Wrap Gate**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_G6i2LmEO2A/XzKkD7wxutI/AAAAAAAAARw/JAxVduY81_koajNyPA9eD4BXveI7cDGkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/03.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_G6i2LmEO2A/XzKkD7wxutI/AAAAAAAAARw/JAxVduY81_koajNyPA9eD4BXveI7cDGkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/03.jpg)

  

Now for the quirk of a villain. Not all villains are capable of butchering heroes in a fight, but not all of them have to. Even villains need support units, and Kurogiri's extraordinary quirk is vital for any mission that the League of Villains undertakes. With it, Kurogiri can create portals of black mist that can teleport a person right away. This is well suited for setting up raids, and the raiding party can retreat just as quickly. If pressed, Kurogiri can also use Warp Gate to disorient an opponent and nullify their moves by teleporting them to unexpected places. Tricky!

  

**2\. Erase**

[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bxi96RjcXHg/XzKkKT-R-oI/AAAAAAAAAR4/iNkBD4P1BqUdeUL6RZrbzdLXV5hSwW9ZACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/02.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bxi96RjcXHg/XzKkKT-R-oI/AAAAAAAAAR4/iNkBD4P1BqUdeUL6RZrbzdLXV5hSwW9ZACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600-rw/02.jpg)

  

Shota Aizawa's hero name is Eraserhead, and for good reason! His quirk is simple: so long as he maintains a line of sight on another person, the target's quirk is completely nullified! This erasure quirk does have its limits; for one, it cannot undo mutation quirks. Looking at Toru Hagakure won't make her visible, for example. But for the most part, Aizawa can render nearly anyone powerless, and he has the skills to fight them with his bare hands. Though if need be, he can step back and let another hero finish things.

  

**1\. Creation**

It's easy to see how Momo Yaoyorozu's quirk ranks first on a list like this. Momo's melee skills are limited (Fumikage had no trouble knocking her out of a tournament battle), but her quirk is incredible. With it, she can create nearly any non-living item from her skin, limited only by how much bodily fat and lipids she has to fuel that ability. Her genius IQ means that Momo can understand the composition of anything from cannons to stereos to gas masks and beyond. A big brain and quick wit are needed to unlock this quirk's potential, and fortunately for hero class 1-A, Momo has both.
